I told you so during the election and during the campaign. Inflation is skyrocketing. Unemployment is rising at a level that nobody can believe. Main streets are being boarded up. Murders are through the roof. You look at what’s happening in these Democrat-run cities. Violent gangs or drugged-out vagrants are taking over our big cities, our once great cities. Corruption is rampant. The senior ranks of our military have been politicized. Our leaders are issuing unconstitutional executive mandates and our country is being turned into a migrants camp.

You remember, we had Make America Great Again, then I said, oh boy, now we have to do it again because what they’ve done. So we had Make America Great Again, again. Again, again. We made a great and now we’ve got to make a great again. That begins with an earth-shattering win in November 2022. And by the way, we never forget 2020, just in case you have any questions. We’re not forgetting 2020. The most corrupt election in the history of our country. Most corrupt election in the history of most countries, to be followed by an even more glorious victory in November of 2024. We’re going to have a big, big, beautiful group then.\n",

      "If we have a country left in 2024, that’s the problem. We’re going to have a country left. And what they’re doing at this level, what they’re doing at this level, you’re not going to have a country left. There’s no greater crisis facing our nation today than the catastrophe on our Southern border. You’ve been watching it and a lot of the fake news. And you got a lot of them back … Look at all of those fake newspeople. Wow. It’s amazing. They’re doing our country no favor. They’re doing you no favor and they’re doing themselves no favor. American sovereignty is being extinguished by the deliberate and willful policies put in place by Joe Biden and the left-wing extremist he has installed in power. I don’t know if Joe is exactly involved. I don’t know. I don’t know. I really don’t. But somebody is really screwing up our country and destroying our country. In Del Rio, Texas, you’ve been watching tens of thousands of illegal immigrants have overrun our borders in recent days while laughing in the faces of our border patrol agents. And they’re going after the riders of the horses, not the people that came in illegally. Isn’t that incredible? And they’ve just put them under watch. They’re in big trouble, the riders of those horses. Most people would say they were doing one hell of a job, right? Don’t you agree? They’re in trouble, can you believe it?\n",
      "Donald Trump: (08:24)\n",
      "One thing is certain, this would never, ever be happening if I were your president and we should have been your president. 75 million votes. When I was in the White House, illegal aliens knew that if they broke our laws and trespassed across our borders, they would be caught, they would be detained, and they would be thrown out of our country very rapidly. So they didn’t come. They didn’t come because it was not worth the trip and then you have to go back. It wasn’t worth the trip.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (08:56)\n",
      "When they made the statement, come with open arms, the world is coming into our country. They’re emptying their prisons into our country. I used to say from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico, but now it’s from many countries all over the world, including the Middle East, they’re emptying their prisons into our country. We’re having people coming into our country that we do not want. We do not want. Under my administration, we ended catch and release. We shut down asylum for it. We struck historic agreements with Mexico and Central American nations to stop illegal immigration and we deported dangerous criminal aliens by the tens of thousands, including MS-13 killers. We got them out by the thousands. We built almost 500 miles of powerful border wall. And it was tough because we had to go through two and a half years of litigation against Democrats that were suing us, including Congress. We created the most secure border in the history of the United States of America.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (10:12)\n",
      "And the wall could have been finished in a month. They didn’t want to finish the wall. This is not even believable. It took us … We were building at record rates, but we had to get the approval from the courts. Two and a half years of fighting and winning 11 different cases. Now, Joe Biden is thrown the border wide open and our country is being invaded by hundreds of thousands of people every single month. Every month, we have hundreds of thousands of people coming, and we don’t even see the people that are really coming in. And I guarantee you, they’re the worst of all. According to one report, over 220 miles of the area near Del Rio is now completely and completely, totally just absorbed by people, but totally unpatrolled.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (11:02)\n",
      "By people, but totally unpatrolled. The police are saying, “What do we do? This is an invasion.”\n",
      "Crowd: (11:16)\n",

      "Donald Trump: (11:28)\n",
      "He could finish that wall in one month. And the contractors are all suing now. They’re going to make more money. They have contracts to build the wall, finish the wall. They said, “Terminate. Let’s terminate. First day, we’re going to terminate.” And now the contracts are going to get more money for not building than they ever got for building. You got some contractors over here. They’re laughing, because they know exactly what I’m saying. Don’t you? Biden terminated our asylum agreements, instituted nationwide catch and release, crippled ICE. These are great patriots, ICE. Tough. I wouldn’t want that job. That guy with the beautiful jacket on… Come here. Let me look at him. Look at that beautiful… Stand up in the chair. Stand up in that chair. Help him. Look at this guy.\n",

      "Oh boy. And he’s a great guy and a great patriot. And when he takes that back off, he goes into his shirt and he probably goes back to his accounting office, but we love you. You’re great, and we appreciate your support. Really great. We appreciate it. Great guy. Great guy. But even sleepy-eyed Chuck Todd of NBC News was recently forced to admit that Biden’s open borders and his policies are acting as a magnet attracting illegal aliens from all over the planet. Yet, despite this obvious disaster, radical Democrats in the house and Senate continue to push for mass amnesty. It’s really hard to believe they think this is good when you look at what’s happening. Haiti is emptying out into our country. Haiti. They have a lot of problems in Haiti, and it’s very sad, but we’re bringing people into our country that it’s just a terrible, terrible, terrible situation.\n",

Other countries, even if they’re not well-equipped, they put up a fight. They don’t let people come in. We’re just letting them just walk right in. And your own Senator Raphael Warnock has not uttered a single solitary word of criticism, because he’s a Marxist controlled by the radical left Democrats who don’t believe in borders, and they don’t believe in a nation. And they don’t believe in our nation. I don’t believe they believe in our nation. Next year, Warnock and every single one of these far-left lunatics must be routinely and resoundingly and decisively defeated. They have to be defeated. You’re not going to have a country left. If you want to have a country left, you must elect no Democrats and vote only for America First Republicans. America first.\n",

I thought we could sort of put it aside for a while. But as soon as they came in, we said, “We need that one again.” But we have some good ones. But, when you think about it, some of those phrases, they’re so on. They’re so perfect. Think about Make America Great Again, Save America, America First. Think of it, America First.\n",

It doesn’t work.” He doesn’t believe. But it’s true. They don’t believe in America first. They don’t believe in America first policies. The world is eating our lunch. They’re laughing at us. They watch what happened in Afghanistan, and they think we’re weak and stupid. And I’ll tell you, when I was president, they respected us. They respected this country, because they were ripping us off and we stopped it. We stopped it, and we’ll go into it, too. For the last eight months, Biden, Pelosi, and the socialist Democrats have been relentlessly pushing the demented lie that their political opponents are the number one threat. Think of it. The number one threat to national security. They call them the Trump people. You know what that is? That’s 75 million people, but it’s really much more than that, much, much more than that.\n",

Obama went down way down, but he won. Well, I don’t know. Maybe he won. Who the hell knows if he won. Nowadays with these elections, who knows if he won, but he went down a lot, and he won. Most of them go down. Some of them go up. But if they go up, they don’t go up much. We went up by 12 million votes. I was told, “Sir,” a great pollster. “So we got 63 million.” He said, “Sir, if you go up 1 million votes, you can’t lose.” Well, we went up 12 million votes, and they say we lost, but there never has been a concession.

She’s not going to concede. Of course having her, I think, might be better than having your existing governor, if you want to know what I think. Might very well be better. But when she says that, no problem. When crooked Hillary Clinton says, “Don’t ever concede,” but she conceded. Of course, I got her at three o’clock in the morning. There was something going on there.\n",

And, honestly, it would’ve been a lot easier for me if I did like every politician. “I’d like to congratulate sleepy Joe on running a brilliant race from the basement.” Somebody ran a good race. We don’t know who the hell it was. It was somebody ran a good race. But the fact is that we ran a great race. A major media group came, and they interviewed me two weeks ago. They go, “Sir, what was the difference between 2016 and 20 20?” They meant that as a negative question. I said, “Well, let me tell you the difference. We did much better in 2020 than we did in 2016.” We did much better.\n",

And the person said, “I never thought of that. I never.” He wasn’t that bad. He was radical left, but he wasn’t that bad. But he did say, “I followed your campaign. It was the most incredible campaign I’ve ever witnessed. Where you would get up and do three, four and five of these rallies a day, and you did that for 30 days before the election.” He said, “I’ve never seen anything like that.” And he said, “There has never been anything like that in the history of politics in this country, and probably in the history of politics in the world.

In their memory tonight, we have 13 empty seats of honor right here in the front row. Our hearts go out to the families of every service member that we have lost that I’ve spoken to a lot of them. And these are great, great people. Thank you. And we’re also honored to be joined by one of the marines who bravely served in Kabul during the withdrawal and helped evacuate children over the airport and over the airport wall. You saw him.

Biden surrendered, our forts and air base in Bagram. We were going to keep the air base because it’s right next to China and their military institutions and their installations and they have a lot of things surrounding it, and we had this big, beautiful air base that caused billions of dollars to build and we were gone. We didn’t even turn out the lights. And one day we were gone and you know who’s looking at it now and who’s all over it? China. We were never leaving that. We had a perfect plan and they were listening to us. Abdul Abdul. You can’t shoot our soldiers.\n",

You can’t do it, and he understood that and he left us alone and we would’ve never moved our military out first. We would’ve never. They would’ve gone last. First, Americans then are people that deserve to come out of which, by the way, the people that came out are not the ones that they were talking about. That was just like a mad rush. But Abdul understood that he was not going to do anything to us. And we would’ve taken our soldiers out last. We would’ve bombed our five bases and we were going to occupy Bagram for a long time to come and it would’ve been so good, but this guy, they just took the military out first. That’s like the captain of the ship, much more severe. By the way, if a captain of a ship goes, you say, all right, he didn’t have guts, but it’s not going to affect it too much.\n",

Sir, the military has left. They’ve abandoned. They’ve surrendered. They’ve quit, whatever the hell he said. And I guarantee, he said, there’s no way that happened. Nobody could be that stupid. They’re smart. They’re good fighters. The Taliban, the Afghans generally are very good fighters, very good, among the best actually. And they said, no, no, he it. And they sent a group in and they said, you know what? The military’s not there anymore. That’s why we had to bring people in that weren’t even familiar with all of it.\n",

They want to silence me just like they’ve silenced so many others. It’s one of the reasons we don’t get the support we should from a lot of very good Republicans, but they’re not as brave as they have to be. And others are in agreement with us, but they’re afraid. The people we are dealing with are evil and angry and destroying our country. They’re destroying our country and they want to go after me because they think a big mouth. I don’t have a big mouth. You know what I have? I have a mouth that tells the truth. I have a mouth that wants to save our country. Now, Biden is bringing into the United States tens of thousands of unvetted, unscreened Afghan nationals who never worked with the Americans before, including those with child brides. They have a child bride, 13, 14 years old, and we’re going to resettle them, I guess, with the child bride. Are they doing that with the child bride? A lot of those people that rushed the planes are not the people that worked with us. They’re people that wanted to get out. You’re going to see some bad things happen over the coming years. It’s a disgrace.\n",

Ask Germany, how are they doing? They’re not too happy. Ask Sweden, how are they doing? They want to tell you the nice Liberal way, but it’s not working out too well. Biden terminated our very hard fort for travel ban. You remember the travel ban? We don’t want people coming from countries that want to destroy us. Okay. It’s pretty simple.\n",

It was very tough because all it says is people that want to blow up our stores and blow up our streets and our cities, people that want to hurt people, people that don’t love our country, we don’t want you in the United States. That’s the travel ban. And Biden is drastically increasing the number of so-called refugees who would be resettled in America and all over American communities all over next year. He’s expanding that number, but the travel ban was so strong. It was so good. When a country was angry at us, when they were bad, when they had people that wanted to blow our streets up and our stores up and set stores on fire and set our cities burning, we had a travel ban. We said, no, thank you. You can keep them. We’re not letting them in. He is now officially ended the travel ban. It’s a disgrace.\n",

Biden did not even say the word China in his UN speech because he’s too compromised to take them on, and he only briefly mentioned Afghanistan because his withdrawal has been such a disaster for him and our country, and by the way, for his poll numbers, which have tanked. In short, after just eight months, Joe Biden is already the biggest failure ever to occupy the Oval Office, and I can think of a couple of people. I’ll tell you what, Jimmy Carter is extremely happy right now. So is another president, but I won’t mention his name because there might be about three people here at that thought he was okay.\n",

They’re ripping us off just like every other country in the world.” Now, by the way, they’re really ripping us because of what they’ve done with energy. They’re making a fortune because of Biden.

Do you ever hear anything about Russia?” “No.” Then a third one comes up a month later. “Sir. Do you have anything to do with Russia?” “No.” After about four or five times, you know the way it is. I said, “What the hell is going on with Russia?” And that’s what’s going on with Russia. They made up a hoax, and we had to live with it for three years.

I give my credit to Biden on that one. He’s very, very disappointed about that. But the same guy that would get up at a microphone and say, “President Trump’s son is involved with Russia.” Call, “Don, do you have anything to do with Russia?” He didn’t know what the hell I was talking about.

And it was paid for by the Democrats and paid for by Hillary Clinton and some others. The big Steele dossier. Remember Steele? That was written. Turned out to be a total fake document. They made up all the stories. Thank goodness, because there were a couple in there that I didn’t like. And the lawyers for the Democrat party, Michael Sussmann. He was just fired, and he was just fired and arrested for what he did. And you have another one, Mark Elias.

Just like they tried on the 2016 election with a totally fabricated con job, what they did in 2020 was far worse, far worse, and much more sophisticated, more highly sophisticated. They worked on this for four years, and we were given a few weeks to find out what they did. We knew it was fake. We knew what they were doing, but we were given a very small part of time.

Your secretary of state. Raffensperger. Raffensperger. I’m telling you, I think there’s something wrong with him. And we give him so much. Could you look at this? Could you look at that? Election integrity. Could you? And sometimes, “Yes, I’m going to look at.” Nothing ever happens. Raffensperger. Something really strange with him.

And your RINO governor, Brian Kemp, who’s been a complete disaster on election integrity, a complete and total … And I’m not looking to say that. I’m not looking to say that. He’s been a complete and total disaster on election integrity. If you go in with a complaint about election integrity, you get investigated instead of investigating a crooked election. It’s the craziest. And some of you know this story, I was called by a very good friend of mine who happens to be here tonight. Sir, could you please endorse? I think we’re 148 and two with endorsements. They like my endorsement. It’s never happened before. Sir, could you please endorse Brian Kemp? I said, “Who the hell is Brian Kemp?” This is at the beginning. There were four or five. I think it’s five.

Sometimes I do because it’s better than a Democrat, right? But I said, “Did he ever say anything bad?” We checked, and it was nothing bad. He hadn’t been too deep into politics, I guess.

The big monster rallies at the airport because no arena could hold the people. And they weren’t there for him. They were there for me. And Stacey Abrams, who still has not conceded, and that’s okay. Stacey, would you like to take his place? It’s okay with me. She still has not conceded, but we had, just so you understand, we had the most incredible rallies, the most incredible rallies. And I said, “Brian, you’re going to win.” “Oh, I don’t think so.” “No, you’re going to win. I’m telling you.” And he ended up winning by like two points, right?

But if these guys would come back, young guys, “Sir, we spoke to Governor Kemp. Sir, he will not do anything on election integrity.” I said, “No. Just call him again.” I mean, maybe he never got the message. They come back the next day, “Sir, Governor Kemp won’t do anything on election integrity.” Remember we wanted to call a special election, so that we could go, Marjorie, into election integrity.

This is easy.” I got this guy elected. One thing has nothing to do with the other. One thing has nothing… There’s no quid pro quo. You remember that word from the fake Ukraine deal. The fake Ukraine… We had Russia, Russia, Russia, Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine. They were both fake deals. Okay? I got impeached twice on fake news, but I said to these young people, “Let me handle it.” I was going to show them how good I am. “Let me handle it. I’ll call them up.” I said, “Brian, listen. you have a big election integrity problem in Georgia.

They ignore… and just, he’s been a real horrible… I could have anybody else… You have another bad one, by the way. You have another bad one, Ducey in Arizona. He’s another beauty, but not as bad as what you have here. Not as bad. They ignored monumental evidence of rampant fraud. We’ve all seen the video of ballots being pulled out from under the tables after kicking out all of the observers. Remember that? Based on a made-up story of “Sir, there’s a major water main break clean out.” Water main break that never happened.\n",

But supposedly caused the vote counting to be shut down for hours and hours. So everyone was out except for these people that were on tape. In addition, Brian Kemp, Raffensperger, and your state leaders surrendered Stacey Abrams. They totally surrendered to her. I think he’s afraid of Stacey Abrams. I don’t understand that. Stacy, you have a great team. Okay? We talked about that, but I saw him being interviewed by Laura Ingram, who’s fantastic, and he was interviewing… although it was a very soft interview on this case, but she’s fantastic. And I don’t say he’s a man of large stature. I’m being very nice. And he said, “I love football.” And she said, “What position do you play?” “I’m an offensive tackle in high school.”\n",
      "Donald Trump: (03:34)\n",
      "Now, even in high school, he was not an offensive tackle. Somehow I remembered that. I don’t know why. Herschel say, “What the hell was that all about, sir?” He’s not an offensive tackle, but your state leaders surrendered to Stacey Abrams and allowed themselves to be bullied into a disastrous consent decree that effectively abolished signature verification and paved the way for massive fraud. And they don’t want to do anything about it. They don’t. I’ll tell you, a couple of people do and their legislators and they’re here right now, but they didn’t want to do anything about it. And the agreement was never approved by the state legislature anyway. It wasn’t even approved. Just recently, it was reported your state, this isn’t Arizona now, this is the great state of Georgia. It was reported that 43,000 absentee ballot votes were counted in DeKalb County that violated the chain of custody rules.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (04:35)\n",
      "Now you have to remember that Georgia was decided by only 11,779 votes, so I only needed one more vote than that to win the election. But we have many, many more votes than we needed to win the election. I recently sent the Georgia Secretary of State a letter outlining the glaring issue, and I’ve never gotten a response. Somebody said, “They’re looking at me for questioning the election.” That’ll be an interesting one. Let’s go after Trump, because he’s questioning the election. If I won or lost, all I want is a fair election. That’s all you want. But I have no doubt that we won, and we won big.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (05:27)\n",
      "There are… Listen to these numbers. These are Georgia numbers and these come from the state, they told me. I said, “Are you sure these numbers are right?” They said, “They’re right.” So let me apologize if they’re not, but they are right. There are 10,300 individuals in Georgia who moved more than 30 days before the November election to a different county in Georgia but failed to reregister and vote in their current county of residence. That means their votes don’t count, but the votes counted. There are 4,052 individuals who voted but whose names do not appear on the Georgia registered voter list. Oh, that’s a little bit of a problem. There are 18,325 individuals in Georgia who voted whose addresses are recorded, or the US Postal Service says, vacant. They’re vacant. It’s vacant.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (06:22)\n",
      "During the hand recount falsified tally sheets were discovered showing unanimous votes and votes counted exclusively for Joe Biden. Ballot images obtained through a public records request revealed duplicated votes, which included at least 3,390 extra votes for Joe Biden. In Fulton County, 100,000 tally sheets for mail-in ballots were missing for months following the election. Oh gee, I wonder how that happened. Georgia officials also took $45 million from Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg to fund election related activities.\n",
      "Crowd: (07:10)\n",
      "Lock him up. Lock him up. Lock him up.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (07:10)\n",
      "Well, they shouldn’t be looking at that. What is that all about? Over 90% of this funding they say for the November election was given to Democrat areas of the state and used to boost Democrat voter turnout. What’s that all about? You know, they have a limit of like $5,200. He’s given millions and millions of dollars to different states, not only Georgia. Among other things, that’s for the famous drop boxes that you hear about where a vast percentage of the votes in the unlocked and unguarded boxes were for Biden. They were for Biden, even though we know who most of them were for. According to True the Vote, great group, at least 7% of the drop box vote was illegally trafficked. That’s 92,000 votes in the Atlanta metropolitan area alone. That’s 92,000. Remember, we’re talking about little more than 11,000. 92,000. That’s one of many categories.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (08:10)\n",
      "In addition, a new investigation by True the Vote, very respected group, alleges a gigantic illegal ballot harvesting operation involving large numbers of people throughout the state. With all of these discrepancies and criminal acts, Governor Kemp and Raffensperger and your attorney general, who unfortunately has not decided to get involved other than looking at people that are questioning the votes, aren’t interested in the people that committed the voter fraud. They’re only interested in me and others, because I bring voter fraud to the forefront in order to save our nation from corrupt elections and to make sure that this never ever happens again. Never happens again. Even the Fulton County DA, district attorney, is after me, but no one is willing to give us the information we want in Fulton County. And Fulton county has a terrible reputation for voter corruption, probably among the worst in the country. They say I’m being aggressive, but you have to be aggressive to weed out this horrible election corruption. You have to be aggressive. In truth, they’re not after me, they’re after you. I just happened to be in the way. That’s what’s really happening. Yesterday, we also got the results of the Arizona audit, which were so disgracefully reported by those people back there. And the headlines claiming that Biden won. That Biden won. Our fake news at a very big lie. They like to… You ever notice when they write about that, they will say, “While the election results are a big lie,” every reporter, it’s just total misinformation. “While they’re totally unfounded,” everything’s unfounded, big lie, not correct. “While Trump has no reason to say this.” I mean, we got piles and piles of information, affidavits by the thousands and thousands. It’s a disgrace. We won on the Arizona forensic audit yesterday at a level that you wouldn’t believe. And what I’m going to do is I’m going to read off for you their results, right from their page. These are very talented people, yet it’s so difficult, because the Washington Post the New York Times and virtually every mainstream media source, CNN, forget it, they’re so dishonest… By the way, their ratings are down 81%. Would you say this?\n",
      "Donald Trump: (11:07)\n",
      "And, likewise, CNBC and, likewise, those crooked newscasts… And, by the way, Greg Gutfeld is number one in the evening now, and he’s on cable and he’s great, but he’s number one. He’s beaten… Because people, they’re not funny. These people aren’t funny. Frankly, I think they’re sick. There’s nothing funny about them, but you have a cable person beating all these guys with all that money. I hope Fox is going to pay Greg what they’re making, add it up together. That’s what I did on the apprentice. I said, “I have higher ratings than all these big stars on the apprentice.” I said to NBC at the time, “They loved me so much during the apprentice. They went bad.” Well, they didn’t want me to run. They didn’t want me to run. They said, “Please, another three years, another five. We’ll do whatever.”\n",
      "Donald Trump: (11:53)\n",
      "They did not want me to run. They said, “You won’t win. Why would you give up a primetime show that’s doing so well?” And then I did it and look what happened. My life was so simple. My life was so simple. I should have just… But what we’ve done is so important. What we’ve exposed is so important. What we’re doing, and what we’re going to do, is going to be the most important of all. But they had headlines that Biden wins in Arizona when they know it’s not true. He didn’t win in Arizona. He lost in Arizona based on the forensic audit. And some people say, and I understand this and I have great, great friends that really want what’s best for us, they say, “Sir, you’re leading in every poll by numbers like nobody’s ever seen before. Think to the future, not to the past.”\n",
      "Donald Trump: (13:02)\n",
      "And I say, “If we don’t think about the past, you’ll never win again in the future, because it’s all rigged.” It’s all rigged. I understand what they’re saying, but it’s all rigged. And it’s a massive disinformation campaign by the corrupt and very fake media. It’s a disinformation. So here’s what they say. Here’s what they say. You ready? This is from the report. How do we look up there? Okay? Not bad. Let’s say, wow. That’s a nice screen. Who the hell else gives you a screen like that? So here’s from the report. This is from the forensic audit by very respected people. And it was a very, very conservatively done reports, much worse than this. The astounding findings include… Ready? 23,344 mail-in ballots were counted despite the person no longer living in that address. Oh, that’s good. So they mailed in, but there’s nobody living there. 23,000. The entire margin in the state was only 10,457 of us. I remember this, because each one of these categories are more than you need. More than you need.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (14:27)\n",
      "So you have a little over 10,000 votes that I quote “lost by.” But all these things happened. There were 17,322 duplicate ballots, which renowned computer scientist Dr. Shiva identified as having surged right after the election was over. Between November 4th and November 9th scores of mail-in ballot duplicates emerged. Duplicates. You know what a duplicate is, right? Oh, how did that happen? 96% of the ballots that came in on two of these days were duplicates.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (15:03)\n",
      "… that came in on two of these days were duplicates. There were 2,382 votes who voted in person even though they had moved out of the county. 2081 voters had moved out of the state. They’re not allowed to vote, but they voted anyway. 5,047 people, remember a little over 10,000, 11… think of that. I mean, just give that a little thought. Every one of these numbers. 5,047 people voted in more than one county resulting in up to 5,295 what they call overvotes. It’s an overvote. In other words, you’re supposed to vote in one county, not two. How many people voted in three or four? I wonder.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (15:47)\n",
      "There were at least 282 dead people who happened to vote. Maricopa County’s official canvas recorded 3,432 more ballots cast than people they recorded as having cast a vote. That’s tough, right? 277 precincts have more ballot cast than people. They have more ballots cast than they have people resulting in at least 1,551 excess votes. 9,041 mail-in votes and voters. Well, just to be exact. You know what? We have to get this exactly accurate because the fake news will say, “He said votes, instead of voters.” 9,041 mail-in voters returned more ballots than they were sent. Oh, that’s interesting. How does that happen?\n",
      "Donald Trump: (16:42)\n",
      "Then this is from a canvasing report that was done by a very respected group. 255,326, remember, you’re talking about a little over 10,000 votes. 255,326 early votes do not have a corresponding record in the county’s voter file. Oh, that’s interesting. 284,412 ballots and ballot images were “corrupt or missing.” This is from their report. I didn’t write this report. This is findings. They call it findings. Then the fake news said that I lost. We lost by a little over 10,000. Hundreds of thousands of votes we’re talking about.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (17:29)\n",
      "All of this was found without being given access to the routers, which county officials ruthlessly withheld. They didn’t want to give those routers under any circumstances. They had to be fought all the way. The county, the people that run the county, they fought us every, not me. They fought the Senate. They fought the Senate of Arizona and the Governor Ducey was horrible. He was missing in action. He was actually against it. Nonetheless, the auditors discovered that millions of election-related files were deleted during and after the election in violation of federal law, including a purge of the “election management system.” That’s a quote, “election management system” software the day before the audit began.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (18:20)\n",
      "The audit’s going to now begin. They went to court. The same guy that I guess got fired. Something happened to him, Elias. He went to court. They sent in 107 lawyers to fight us on this, to fight the people, to fight the Senate, 107. Oh, she said 170. That could be right. All these lawyers, they just emerged one day in Arizona, all the court cases, and the Senate hung in and they won. In addition, in another effort led by patriot Liz Harris, the Maricopa County canvassing results for Arizona were just published. Is Liz Harris here? No way. Why do you like Liz Harris so? What the hell do you know about Liz? Huh? She’s a patriot.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (19:06)\n",
      "Biden supposedly won the state of Arizona by 10,457 votes. Yet, the report shows 173,104 lost votes and 96,389 ghost votes. You know what a ghost vote is, right? Where is it? Where is it? Harris stated that a conservative estimate of votes impacted was 299,493. It is estimated that 173,104 voters had their votes stolen. Look at those lights going out over there. Oh my God. The lights, I’m telling you, the television lights are going out. This is the most interesting part of the speech. The rest of my speech, you’ve sort of heard before, right? Regarding ghost votes, Maricopa County recorded and estimated 96,000 mail-in votes that could not have been physically cast by the voter that the vote was registered to, could not have been done by the voter that it was registered to. 96,000. That’s nine times more than I need right there. That’s just one little category. The media aren’t reporting this stuff. They’re saying that the election results are fine. It’s going, it’s just not acceptable.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (20:36)\n",
      "Just like they don’t want to talk about Afghanistan or Hunter Biden’s corruption. That’s the other thing that came out today. You see that? They delayed the Hunter Biden corruption because they didn’t want it to hurt Joe Biden’s chances of election. Look what happened with Joe Biden as your President. Our country has gone to hell.\n",
      "Speaker 1: (21:47)\n",

They’re trying to take our country away, and they’re trying to steal our country, and they’re going to ruin our country. Once it’s destroyed, remember I used to say, we will not become Venezuela. This is what’s happening. Now this is what’s happening. You take a look at Venezuela. They can’t get water. They can’t get anything. They’re living in hell. We will not be a socialist country. How many times have I said it? This will not be Venezuela. This is going to be Venezuela very soon if they keep going the way they’re going. This is all done in a period of less than nine months.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (22:26)\n",
      "Think of it. This destruction of our border, all of the destruction, our military in retreat, we’ve never had a military retreated before. Why would you leave 83 or 85 billion dollars worth of equipment? Why would you leave brand new blackhawk helicopters, the greatest machine? Why would you leave millions and millions? Why as an example? There was no reason. We had it so under control. We were getting the hell out there, but everybody would’ve come out. We would’ve then taken the equipment. I even gave an expression. I want every screw, every bolt, every nail. I want the tents that the equipment has had. I want everything.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (23:10)\n",
      "Milley said to me one time. I’ll never forget it. “Sir, it’s more expensive. It’s more expensive, sir, to take the equipment than to leave it.” I said, “Really, you mean you have a $10 million tank. You put it on a plane and that’s more expensive than leaving it?” He said, “It’s more expensive.” And I never forgot that statement because that’s probably the first time I realized that he was stupid. But you know what I did say? I said, “We have brand new aircraft just out of the factory. It’s sitting on the runways and our soldiers are fleeing and surrendering to guys with knives.” Good fighters, by the way. But guys with knives that I got along with very well. They understood. They’re not going to screw around. I almost used the F word. It would’ve been more effective if I did, but they would’ve … he used a horrible word. So I didn’t do it. Remember I didn’t do it.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (24:04)\n",
      "It would’ve been so much more effective if I used the word. Maybe later on, but with Milley and with all these people, they flee. I said, “Why wouldn’t you have brought in 200 pilots, 200? We have the best pilots in the world. We have the best soldiers in world. We have the best military in the world.” I rebuilt the military. Space force. Don’t forget space force. I rebuilt. Why wouldn’t you bring over real fast?\n",
      "Donald Trump: (24:36)\n",
      "First of all, you shouldn’t have left anything behind. I don’t even like this idea, but assuming they really wanted to leave it behind because they’re stupid, why wouldn’t you bring over 200 pilots? Just take the planes and fly them to Pakistan. Then you bring them over or fly them to some other country of which we give them all so much money that they all treat us well. Okay. We get ripped off by everybody, but why wouldn’t you fly the planes out? They said they’d leave the planes.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (25:02)\n",
      "Then they said because they were so embarrassed because they probably didn’t even know what they were doing, they had no idea what they were doing. They said, “No, well, we disabled it.” You know what they did? They let the air out of a couple of tires of one plane. They didn’t disable anything. These guys have the best equipment anywhere in the world. They’re probably the best armed soldiers and equipped soldiers in the world. They have goggles, the likes of which nobody, the night goggles, they call them. I can see at night better than I can at 12:00 in the afternoon with the sun. That’s how good they are. Better than our soldiers have, the latest models. And they have thousands and thousands. They have hundreds of thousands of rifles and weapons and machine guns. Hundreds of, we left it there. There was no reason to leave it there.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (25:47)\n",
      "We could have taken a year, two years, four years or two months to get the hell out. There was no reason. We had them so at bay. They weren’t going to play games because they knew that if they did, they were going to get hit harder than any nation has ever been hit at their home because it’s all about their home. Because they were never hit at their home, but we know where their homes are, and we were going to hit them very hard. They understood that. That’s why I told you before, 18 months we didn’t have one soldier killed. And even Biden said that it was a mistake. He said, “Well, I will say that no soldiers have been killed in 18 months.” And his people are screaming at him. “Don’t say that you stupid son of a bitch.”\n",
      "Donald Trump: (26:29)\n",
      "He was supposed to add a but, but something bad. But he didn’t do that. As a result of the Arizona forensic audit, 41 legislators from across the nation wrote an open letter to the American people calling for audits in all 50 states and decertification of the election where appropriate. A total decertification. It is clear in Arizona that they must decertify the election. You heard the numbers, and those responsible for wrongdoing must be held accountable. It was a corrupt election. It’s my opinion, by the way, that Georgia is far worse.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (27:35)\n",
      "Hopefully the Arizona attorney general, a good man, will do far more for his state than your attorney general has done for your state because your attorney general has not done what he’s supposed to be doing. What he’s supposed to be doing is free and clear and non-corrupt elections. They’re not doing that. We must elect strong, brave America first leaders who will be true champions for the people and for free, fair and honest elections. We must demand election integrity at all costs. If we don’t have borders, if we don’t have elections, if we don’t have our military back and strong, I rebuilt the military and now look what happens. They’re giving it away to the enemy. To think 28 Apache helicopters. You don’t know. I hate to use the term, but it’s considered, I didn’t want to use it before. I said machine, but it’s considered the most incredible killing machine. That’s a horrible term, right? But it’s the most incredible killing machine.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (28:37)\n",
      "When a tank sees an Apache helicopter over the horizon, lifting up, you know what happens to that tank operator? He gets the hell out of there because he doesn’t have a chance. They hit it with a missile right down the middle of the gun. They hit it with a missile right down that barrel. They go, boom. That goes right in from 5, 6, 7 miles away. The tank shoots at them and it’s going like this and they’re waving. Hello? Goodbye. Bing, bing, bing. They take out a lot of them at a time. They got brand new ones. They got to learn to fly them but they will. They will. The Chinese will teach them. The Russians will teach ’em.\n",

I would’ve said, “Well, what the hell are you leaving?” He’s in a district where they love him, where he wins easily. Nobody challenges him. He said, “I have to do this for the good of my state.

A man who is running for Governor, who is a friend of mine, I said, “You know, you ought to be a republican.” He said, “Well, I don’t know, but I sort of like a like of republicans.” He has the view of a lot of republicans.\n",

      "He’s a good man. He’s a great guy. He’s smart. He’s tough. Vernon Jones. Vernon, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Vernon. I just heard this guy’s here. He was a tough cookie. He was a great Police Commissioner of New York. I’m looking for you, Vernon. Why are you on that side, Vernon? Good job, Vernon. Thank you very much. Thank you. See, he’s a rebel. He’s a rebel. That’s what people like about him. Thank you, Vernon. Appreciate it. A man who did a tremendous job in New York, he was a big fan of Rudy Giuliani, who’s a great guy by the way. He was the greatest mayor in the history of the city of New York, that I can tell you, and did a great job. They’d come at him with barrels. They just want to blow people away. It’s a disgrace. This is a man whose tough as hell, tough as nails, and did an incredible job in New York. He’s respected and loved by anybody and everybody. Bernie Kerik is around here someplace. Where’s Bernie? Bernie? Where’s Bernie Kerik? He’s around here. Thank you, Bernie. Great job you’ve done.\n",

      "Candidates for congress, we have some really good ones. Tonight we have Rich McCormick and Jake Evans, thank you. Thank you very much. And you’re shaking it up. I hear you’re going to do very well. Also, a friend of mine for a long time. She’s been with me when it wasn’t really fashionable, Alveda King. I want to thank you. Thank you, Alveda. She was with me when it wasn’t so good [inaudible 00:40:46]. She’s tough and she’s wonderful. She’s a wonderful woman. Thank you, Alveda. I appreciate very much your being here. This is a… Look at this crowd. Look at this crowd of patriots and the love. The love. The love they have. You know as we speak, there are people that are being held prisoner very unfairly, and that should not be allowed to happen. Or if it is going to happen, you have to treat all of the other sides, whether it’s ANTIFAH or BLM, or others that burned down our cities, you have to treat people equally. That’s one of the things we learned a long time ago.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (41:32)\n",
      "Of course, now they’re trying to sell different history books than we used to get, but we’re not going to let that happen. We are people, and Ashli Babbitt who was killed, she was the person that was killed during that day, that lousy day, that horrible day, but they killed Ashli Babbitt. There was no reason to kill Ashli Babbitt, no reason whatsoever. Our hearts are with that group and hopefully that’s going to all work out. I think in the end, it’s going to all work out. It’s a very, very unfair, very, very unfair situation. When you see them burning down our cities like Portland and St. Louis, and I could name city after city, Seattle, they take over Seattle. People get killed. Nothing happens to them. Then you see what happened in Washington, DC. It’s a disgrace.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (42:23)\n",
      "Under our administration, we accomplished four more years of everything. We took care of people at a level that nobody has ever thought possible. No president, and I say this, and I don’t get criticized, no president or certainly very few have accomplished what we accomplished in four years. We passed massive tax cuts and record-setting regulation cuts. We ended NAFTA and the NAFTA disaster, the worst trade deal ever made, and replaced it with USMCA, that’s Mexico and Canada, who were both doing big numbers on our country but not anymore. We withdrew from the job, killing trans-Pacific partnership, stood up to China like nobody has ever stood up, taking in billions and billions of dollars from China when we never took in $0.10 from China. That’s what we were just saying with Sonny, we gave them a lot of money. $28 billion out of that money, and we had a lot left over.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (43:27)\n",
      "Joe Biden is just obliterating much of the hard won success that we had. We had hard won success. That success is going to have to come back, or our country doesn’t stand a chance. We’re not respected anymore as a country. We’re being laughed at all over the world. Afghanistan was the single most embarrassing event in my opinion that’s ever happened to our country. We’re being laughed at all over the world. Last month, the economy added up to one third the jobs that we expected. We expected to have much better employment numbers, and it didn’t work out too good. The unemployment rate for black Americans increased to a very, very high 8.8%. With me, they were way down and going a lot lower.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (44:19)\n",
      "Gas prices in Georgia are now almost 100% higher than they were just last year. You know, when gas prices go up like that, that’s like a massive tax increase. That’s bigger than a tax increase. Inflation is rampant and shortages are becoming widespread for all products. Anybody having trouble getting products? Everybody, probably. Meanwhile, Biden and Congressional democrats are pushing the largest tax increase in the history of our country. We can’t let that happen. The largest tax… It’s going to kill everything that we built. What’s happening with our country, our foundation was so strong that they were able to get away with it for a little while, but eventually those foundations will start to crumble.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (45:03)\n",
      "… with it for a little while, but eventually those foundations will start to crumble. Their socialist legislation would cost a mind boggling $3.5 trillion, over $10,000 from every living American. If you want high taxes, fewer jobs, vote for the radical left Democrats. If you want low taxes, more and more and more jobs, fantastic income, and freedom, vote for Republicans. That’s what’s happening. That’s what’s happening.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (45:36)\n",
      "Biden and the extreme left are also using every lever of the federal government to impose woke nonsense on every facet of American life, pushing toxic, critical race theory into our children’s classrooms and even into our military, and male athletes are now being allowed to participate in women’s sports. How’s that working out? Did you see the recent weightlifting contest? How did that work out? They’re fighting for years and years over two ounces, two ounces, more. I want to get two ounces more. This guy comes along. Bing. And he wasn’t even a weightlifter, right? Yeah, it’s so crazy. It’s so unto fair to women. They fought so hard getting into this position, and it’s so unfair to women, and people don’t understand it. For four straight years, the left carried on a deranged resistance campaign, the likes of which our country has never seen before. It was a lie and another lie and lie after lie and hoax after hoax, a witch hunt after witch hunt. You saw it going with Russia, Ukraine with all of them. Now it’s worse than ever before. The same people are perpetrating these lies and these witch hunts. The same people. They get up, they have no shame. They stand up, and they talk like it’s such a horrible thing. And it’s just a disaster. Nancy Pelosi’s unselect committee of radical Democrats, a biased hit job that is wasting everybody’s time to distract from the Democrats’ epic failures. They are having epic failures. The vice chair of the unselect committee is Liz Cheney. Is everybody having … I mean, look. Our country’s embarrassed. The whole world is laughing at us. But is there any place better to be than a Trump rally? Anything, right?\n",
      "Donald Trump: (48:16)\n",
      "In conclusion, everyone here tonight knows that the extreme left will stop at nothing to destroy the America we love and the American dream. But with all of you in Georgia and conservative patriots all across the nation, we will end their reign of radicalism in Washington DC forever. With a Republican Congress, we will fight for more jobs for Georgia families, fair trade for Georgia workers, and more Georgia factories forging more product stamped with that beautiful phrase Made in the USA. You don’t hear that too much. And you know, they are starting to say very strongly Merry Christmas. Remember when I first ran, I said, you’re going to say Merry Christmas. They’re all saying Merry Christmas again.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (49:09)\n",
      "We better move fast because that’ll end also like everything else. They want to change the name of a school in San Francisco from George Washington to something. George Washington’s name is now under attack. We don’t know what he’s done, but it must be terrible. We will shut down Joe Biden’s border disaster. We will end catch and release, and we will end illegal immigration once and for all in our country, just as I had already done very successfully more so than has ever taken place at our border. We had done it before.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (49:47)\n",
      "We will hold China accountable for unleashing the virus and for the unfathomable suffering they have caused and charge them trillions of dollars in reparations. We will reign in big tech monopolies, reject left wing cancel culture, and we will restore the right to free speech in America. You don’t have free speech anymore. You don’t have a free press anymore. We will protect innocent life. We will defend our constitution. We will defend the second amendment and we will proudly uphold the Judeo-Christian values and principles of our nation’s founding. We will care for our veterans, continue to strengthen our military and give our police officers border patrol. And ICE, these are great, great patriots and law enforcement generally our 100% support. They will not be defunded. We will ban critical race theory in our classrooms. We will ban it in our military. We will ban it from the workplaces, and we will ban it from our federal, state, and local governments. We will restore patriotic education for our schools, and we will teach our children to love their country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag.\n",

      "Our country is against some of the most sinister forces, an entrenched interest that anyone has ever seen in our country. We’ve never seen anything like is happening today. But no matter how big or powerful they may appear, you must never forget. This nation does not belong to them. This nation belongs to you. It belongs to you. This is your home. This is your heritage. And our magnificent American liberty is your God given right. The citizens of the United States of America will not be told how to live, how to think, what to do or what to say by corrupt and incompetent politicians, big tech tyrants, left wing bullies, or anybody else because we are a free, proud, and sovereign people. We have to take back our country.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (52:50)\n",
      "We are descended from the heroes and patriots, the pioneers, the legends who tamed the great wilderness, who settled a vast continent, who worked the fields, laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers and poured out their blood, sweat, and tears to build this country into the greatest nation in the history of the world. We are not going to let it be taken away from us.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (53:21)\n",
      "Our ancestors summoned the courage to fight and win our independence against the most powerful empire on earth. Our parents, grandparents, and great grandparents stormed the beaches to crush fascism. They found the strength to topple communism, and we will not be afraid of woke lunatics, who despise everything those heroes fought so hard for and those heroes fought and died for. There is no mountain we cannot climb. There is no summit we cannot reach. There is no challenge we cannot meet. As long as we remember that we are Americans and there is nothing that Americans cannot do.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (54:14)\n",
      "We will not bend. We will not break. We will not yield. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back down. We will never ever surrender. My fellow Americans, our movement has just begun. In fact, our fight has only just begun. This is the greatest movement in the history of our country, perhaps the greatest movement in any country. We are going to make sure that we see it to the end. Our country will be stronger than ever before because the fact is we are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. With love of our nation swelling in our hearts and the spirit of America staring in our souls, I say these words to you tonight. We will make America powerful again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again.\n",

      "Thank you. Thank you. Wow, this is a big crowd. I’ll tell you. This goes all the way back. I wish they’d show it because they just don’t do that. They don’t like… This goes all the way back. I just looked at it on television, but it’s our television. We show it, but they don’t show it. You know why? Because they’re fake news. Right? They’re fake news. Hello, Alabama. And I’m thrilled to be back in your incredible, wonderful state that we won by a record number. We won this state. We also won a lot of other states by numbers that they don’t tell you about. We did have a rigged election. Didn’t we. It was terrible, terrible. And you look at what’s going on now. You look at what’s going on now and the border, but take a look at Afghanistan, what’s happening.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (09:47)\n",
      "But I’m with thousands of proud, hardworking, incredible American patriots. With your help, we’re going to elect our friend, Mo Brooks, to the U.S. Senate. We’re going to fire Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Joe Biden, and the radical left. And we’re going to make America great again. We have been making it so great. Now they’re biting into that, but we’re not going to let that happen. We can never let that happen. That’s why I had the idea… All my ideas… Someday, they’re going to tell me how to do things. But I liked the George Patton piece. Did you like that, General Patton? I thought so. Because we’re getting a little tired of the woke generals that we have. Right? Where they move our military out before they move our civilians. And before they move $83 billion worth of equipment. Let’s move them out. And the Taliban looks and they say, “I can’t believe it. This could only happen to us. I can’t believe it. The military left.” They go in. We have 45,000 people there, Americans, anywhere from, I guess, 15. They have no idea how many. That’s even worse. They say, “It could be 10. Oh, it could also be 45,000.” But it’s a lot of people and equipment like nobody has anywhere in the world 83 billion dollars.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (11:12)\n",
      "One year ago this month, in my nomination acceptance speech, which you remember. A lot of you were there. I see a lot of you that were there. I warned the entire country of the disastrous consequences of a Biden presidency. I understood it. A lot of you understood it too. I said that Joe Biden would eliminate America’s borders in the middle of a pandemic. He did. I predicted that he would unleash a wave of violent crime that would turn our cities into a nightmare of killing and bloodshed. You look at these Democrat run cities, Chicago, L.A., big cities, small cities, everyone run by a Democrat, New York. They don’t prosecute people in New York, only Republicans they prosecute. They don’t prosecute murderers and killers. They prosecute Republicans. It’s misconduct. It’s called prosecutorial misconduct. But I told you this was going to be happening. We stated it loud and clear.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (12:14)\n",
      "We said he would impose crippling shutdowns and restrictions on in-person schooling and that these painful policies would nonetheless fail to stop the virus. He didn’t stop the virus. They say, “Oh, he gets wonderful marks.” He doesn’t get good marks. He’s done a terrible job, including on vaccinations, including on everything else. And now the virus is back. The virus is back. I’m shaking hands with everybody backstage. I say, “Well, I don’t know. Is this a good thing or bad?” You’ll read about it in three or four days maybe, hopefully not.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (12:51)\n",
      "But I said that Biden would embolden America’s enemies. And that’s what he’s done. And that the radical Democrat socialist agenda would set our nation on the road to economic ruin. You look at what’s going on with inflation. Has anyone noticed that your gasoline is now at levels that you never thought you’d see again, six months ago? So we had $1.87 a gallon and we had a thriving industry, energy independent. Nobody thought we’d ever be energy independent. We didn’t need the Middle East. We didn’t need them. And now you have over five dollars in many cases and it’s going, even here, it’s going to be over five very soon.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (13:39)\n",
      "And I saw the other day before this whole thing with Afghanistan started… Because right now nobody’s talking even about energy, even about the horrible border condition that they’re allowing millions of people to come into our country. People that we have no idea, but people aren’t talking about that. They’re talking about the disaster of Afghanistan.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (13:59)\n",
      "Not only have my predictions come 100% true, but it’s even worse than any of us could have imagined in our worst nightmare. Nobody thought this kind of thing could happen. Biden has obliterated our border, given up our energy independence, caused soaring inflation. He failed totally on economic and policies. I mean, you look at what’s going on. It’s crazy. And the senators that voted for this 1.2 trillion dollar bill of which they call it infrastructure, but only 11% is infrastructure. Where the hell are these people coming from? It’s the roadmap. They call it the glide path.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (14:43)\n",
      "It’s the roadmap to the Green New Deal, conceived and dedicated by A.O.C., a real beauty. She’s a real beauty. She knows more about the environment. I don’t think she ever even took… Did she ever take a course? She wasn’t a good student. Did she ever take a course on the environment? Remember, remember when at first she said you have 12 years to live. She said that two years ago. It means you have, right now you’re about nine and a half years. Somehow, you’re not worried about that, but you are worried about China and Russia and other places. Okay.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (15:19)\n",
      "We rebuilt our military stronger, bigger, better than ever before. And now I see it being dissipated and being given… Our military is being given to the enemy.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (15:35)\n",
      "Biden failed totally on the pandemic. And he’s now overseeing the greatest foreign policy humiliation in the history of the United States of America. This is the greatest humiliation I’ve ever seen. Biden’s botched exit in Afghanistan is the most astonishing display of gross incompetence by a nation’s leader, perhaps at any time that anybody’s ever seen. Name another situation like this. Vietnam looks like a master class in strategy compared to Joe Biden’s catastrophe.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (16:11)\n",
      "And it didn’t have to happen. All he had to do is leave the soldiers there until everything’s out our citizens, our weapons, then you bomb the hell out of the bases. We have five bases. And you say, “Bye, bye.” You say, “Bye, bye.” The scene of those big giant planes, taking off with people hanging on the sides and falling off, there’ll never be anything like that. That’s worse than the helicopters. You remember the helicopters taking off the roofs. This blows it away. Not even a contest. This will go down as one of the great military defeats of all time. And it did not have to happen that way. This is not a withdrawal. This was a total surrender. It was a surrender for no reason. They weren’t asking. We had them. I dealt with Abdul. He was the leader. I said, “Abdul, anything happens, we are going to reign terror upon you. It will be a terrible thing. Don’t touch our American citizens. Don’t ever come to our country. Don’t ever come to our country. And you’re going to continue fighting your civil war.” I can’t do that. They’ve been fighting it for hundreds of years. That’s what they do is they fight and they’re good fighters. But I had a good relationship other than that one statement. After I said that, I said, “Now let’s get down to business.” And we had a conditions-based agreement. And they didn’t meet the first two conditions and we hit them hard. And then they met them. And then they had a couple of other conditions that they were ready to meet. And then we had a rigged election and we had a new President. And the new President came into office, and he dropped to his knees and he said, “Come on in and take everything that we have.” This is a disgraceful thing. The most embarrassing thing that we’ve ever seen in this country. There’s never been an embarrassment. And the nations of the world, both friend and foe are looking at us and saying, “What the hell happened so quickly to the United States of America? They can’t believe it.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (18:28)\n",
      "The equipment that they’ve got is the most sophisticated military equipment in the world. He surrendered our air base. He surrendered our weapons. He surrendered our embassy. They spent a billion dollars building this ridiculous embassy. And he abandoned our great American citizens. They’re over right now. They have no idea. Remember this, the Taliban’s tough and they don’t respect our country and they don’t respect our President. It’s not good. They’re over there now. And they don’t know what’s going to happen, our citizens. Joe Biden was going on vacation as Afghanistan was going to hell.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (19:12)\n",
      "And this is what you get when you have weakness in the White House. You can’t have weakness in the White House. They have to respect your President. When I was President, we only had strength. Remember the 59 shots we took at Syria? 59 missiles, every single one of them hit their target from 700 miles away. And I was sitting with President Xi of China, you remember? Having chocolate cake at Mar-a-Lago. It was wonderful cake. And when I said to him, what we had just done, the missiles were launched, he looked at me and he goes, “Repeat.” I didn’t know. He spoke English actually. He said, “Repeat.” I said, “What did you just say, repeat?” So he spoke a little more English than I thought, because he never said hello. But he said, “Repeat.”\n",
      "Donald Trump: (20:04)\n",
      "And I said, “We just shot 59 missiles in from ships very far away. Every one of them hit their target. It was an incredible display of talent and weapons.” And the reason we did that is because we had to. Because President Obama and Biden drew the red line in the sand and said, “Don’t cross it.” And they crossed it. And nothing happened. That’s when Russia got involved. Russia went in. They said, “Oh, nothing’s going to happen.” So Russia got involved. Other countries got involved. That red line in the sand from President Obama, that was just absolutely, it just didn’t matter. It was just words. That’s the problem with a lot of politicians actually, but not Mo. But it just doesn’t matter. When he said, “Red line don’t ever cross it,” and they crossed it and nothing happened.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (20:58)\n",
      "But the 59 missiles were an incredible display under my administration. Everyone in the world knew not to mess around with America. They knew that. They understood our power and that I would not hesitate to use it in defense of our citizens. And the Taliban understood that maybe as well as anybody. This would never have happened if I was President. Our country was so respected. Everybody respected our country. China respected our country. We took in billions and billions of dollars in taxes and tariffs from China. They never gave us 25 cents. But then of course the China virus came and it was a lot different. My attitude toward China changed. As I personally told the Taliban leader, if anyone ever double crossed the United States of America, it would be the last thing they ever did. We said it loud and clear. And you knew it better than anybody in Alabama knew it. Because one thing, we won Alabama by a record. We won South Carolina by a record. And then they said we lost Georgia. How the hell did that happen? That doesn’t happen. No, we know how that happened. We know how it happened.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (22:29)\n",
      "But under our leadership, America was respected again. Our people did a great job. I’ve been watching Mike Pompeo, Secretary of State. He did a great job and he’s going around spreading the word. And General Kellogg and others have been great. But they understood this would never, could never happen. It could never happen. You never move the military first. You move the military last. We had total control militarily. They would have never come in. We could have kept them there for a long time, but 21 years, we want to bring them home. But we want to bring them home with dignity. Very soon we’re going to have September 11th and you’re going to have, because of Biden, the Taliban flag flying over our embassy, flying over our facilities. So that was not even a possibility that a thing like that could happen.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (23:25)\n",
      "We decimated ISIS. You remember that. ISIS, we had a great, great success. When I took over, ISIS was all over the place. And in a short period of time, we killed its leader and founder Al-Baghdadi. We eliminated the senior ranks of Al-Qaeda and we terminated the world’s top terrorist in Soleimani, who killed a lot of American soldiers and a lot of other people too. And they knew we weren’t playing games. They understood that right from the beginning. This proven record of America’s strength laid the groundwork to safely and responsibly bring our trips back home. Nobody was going to mess with us. And then this clown, they rigged the whole damn deal and he got in office. And now, now they’re taking advantage of us. And remember this, this isn’t stopping. This is going to go on for a long time. This is going to go on for a long time. This isn’t going away. This isn’t like a three-day hit. It’s going to go on for a long time.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (24:35)\n",
      "Taliban, great negotiators, tough fighters, great negotiators, they’ve got 45,000 people. You’ve got a lot of people also that deserve to be helped and they’re not going to let them be helped at all. This is going to go on for a long time. This is a great stain on the reputation of our country. Going into the Middle East was one of the most disastrous decisions that our country has ever been involved with. We’ve never had a decision. In my opinion, it was the…\n",
      "Donald Trump: (25:03)\n",
      "… been involved with. We’ve never had a decision, in my opinion, it was the worst decision that we’ve ever had. It was quicksand, quicksand. We should’ve gone in, knocked the hell out of it. I met a general, his name was general [inaudible 00:25:16]. I don’t even know, maybe he’s not even on my side, who the hell knows with these generals. When I get through with this guy Milley, I mean, how about Milley?\n",
      "Donald Trump: (25:24)\n",
      "Remember, remember? Remember, when I walked to the church, proudly walked to the church that the protesters, they tried to burn it down, but I walked to the church, protestors out there and Milley was walking with me. And the next day, the radical left media starts calling, “You shouldn’t have walked. You shouldn’t have walked.” Instead of saying, “I’m proud to walk with my President,” and not because it’s me because of the office. Instead of saying that, he wanted to apologize for walking with the President of the United States.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (25:58)\n",
      "And I said, ” This guy doesn’t have what it takes.” And you’re seeing that now, because the worst decisions I’ve ever seen… That’s again, why I put the Patton, I just remembered it as I was coming over here. I said, “Get that clip quickly. The people of Alabama understand that clip.” Do you think that… Let me ask you, do you think that General Patton was woke? I don’t think so. What do you think Mike? Mike, was he woke? I don’t think so.\n",
      "Speaker 5: (26:33)\n",
      "We love you Trump.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (26:34)\n",
      "I don’t think he was too woke. He was the exact opposite. You know what woke means? It means you’re a loser. Everything woke, everything woke… It’s true. Everything woke turns to shit, okay. It’s true, it’s true. Look at what’s happening.\n",
      "Speaker 6: (27:04)\n",
      "USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (27:26)\n",
      "I got a little trouble. I said that our women’s soccer team was supposed to easily win, but they went woke except for a few of them. I love those women that stood up and they saluted our flag, there were some of them. But the one with the purple hair, she didn’t play too well. She went, well, you can have her. And they didn’t do too well, unfortunately. We want them to do well, but they didn’t. But it’s true about woke. You just take a look, everything goes bad. It’s really, it’s a shortcut to losing everything you have. They want to get rid of our great heroes and heroines. They want to get rid of our history, our culture. We’re not going to do it.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (28:12)\n",
      "We’re not going to do it. When they were starting to rip down our statues and it started with people, confederate people, generals, some respected, some not, but they’re taking down our culture and our heritage. And then it started with others. And then it went to Robert E. Lee. Robert E. Lee was part of our history and then it went to Abraham Lincoln and Thomas Jefferson. Now, George Washington. In San Francisco they’re taken the name of George Washington off schools. Can you believe it? We’re not going to let this stuff go on. The hardest thing I had to do as president was signing letters to the families of soldiers who were killed in the Middle East. Often I called the parents, very often. Sometimes I went to Dover Air Force Base. That’s where the bodies of the soldiers would come in and I’d see them bringing a young man, young woman in a coffin.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (29:13)\n",
      "And I’d be with the parents. And I’ve told this story a couple of times. The parents would sometimes be unbelievable, you would almost not understand. It was like, “Sir, it’s so great to meet you.” And they’d always tell stories about their child. “So my son could throw a football so long. He was a quarterback in high school. He was a quarterback in college. Sir, I think he could have been in the NFL. He was really good. He was so great.” And we’re waiting for the plane to come in. And sometimes they’d be talking about their daughter. Lots of daughters were killed, coming out of the Middle East. “My daughter was so beautiful, Sir. She was so incredible. She was the greatest.” And I’d say to the general and the colonel that ran Dover, the great people… We have great, by the way, we have great generals. We have great generals. The ones you see on television are not the ones that are great.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (30:07)\n",
      "We have great generals and we have great leaders and a great military that I rebuilt. I rebuilt it. It was exhausted. But I’d say to the general and the colonel that ran Dover and they saw the bodies coming in many days of the week, I’d say, “General, it’s amazing. The parents seem so fine. They can handle it.” “No, they can’t, Sir.” I said, “No, I just spent a half an hour talking to them. They were okay. I mean, they understand what happened. They’re okay.” “No, they’re not, Sir. When that plane pulls up, Sir, that big unbelievable, powerful,” just like you saw three days ago with the bodies dropping off the sides. How desperate are people to leave when you’re hanging, clinging to a plane that goes up thousands of feet and you eventually have to let go, how desperate is that?\n",
      "Donald Trump: (31:06)\n",
      "How sad and how desperate. But when that cargo plane pulled up and that door opened, the general said, “Sir, when that door opens and you had the most beautiful young people carrying a coffin or a number of coffins off of the plane. Sir, when that happens, you’ll see, the parents are not okay.” So I was talking to people that seemed to be fine. I was amazed at their strength. And 10 minutes later, I watched that same mother and that same father screaming, screaming, running to the coffin, as it was being taken off, breaking security lines, you couldn’t stop them. I’ve never seen anything like it. And for what? And for what? And then you have a man who just retreats and gives up and it’s a disgrace. It’s a disgrace to our country. It’s a disgrace. It’s a disgrace to everybody.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (32:10)\n",
      "The most incredible people, but that was the saddest thing, seeing that Dover, you go to Dover. You go also to Walter Reed Medical Center, incredible doctors. I will tell you this, most incredible doctors. And you see the horrific injuries and you see the parents, the wife, the husband standing and looking over the body of somebody that was just absolutely shattered. In some cases, no legs. In one case, I’ll never forget, no legs, no arm. And then the other arm half and said to me, “Sir, I got lucky. I was able to save a half an arm.” And I’m looking and I’m saying, “We can never let this happen again. It was a terrible, terrible thing that happened. It was such a horrific mistake.” But these people represent our nation. They’re the greatest people our nation has ever had. Ever had.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (33:34)\n",
      "Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. So we had a deal where we were going to get out with great honor, and they weren’t going to play games. And we had them melded in with the government, but I’ve never been a big fan of Ghani. I always said he was a total crook. I’ve said it for years. It turned out he was a crook. He was a crook. And he left. He fled. He fled with a lot of cash. What we’ve done, how we got into that mess, it’s just amazing. But we could have gotten out with honor and we should have gotten out with honor. And instead we got out with the exact opposite of honor. Since my administration began negotiating a peace deal last year, somebody said, “Oh, he’s dealing with the Taliban.” Who the hell else am I supposed to deal with?\n",
      "Donald Trump: (34:24)\n",
      "Deal with the people that ran or the people that were highly paid, we paid the soldiers. They were among the highest paid soldiers of the world. I remember a certain, highly overrated general came to my office, “Sir, they’re fighting for their lives. They’re fighting For their country.” I said, “No, general, they’re paid more than any soldier in the world. And when that payment stops, they’re gone.” And that’s exactly what happened. Exactly what happened. But since my administration began the negotiations on the peace deal last year, not a single American service member has been killed in combat in Afghanistan. It’s over 18 months now, 18 months.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (35:05)\n",
      "And you know why that is? Not because the Taliban aren’t great fighters because they are great fighters. All you have to do is ask Russia, which used to be called the Soviet Union. And because of Afghanistan, it’s now Russia, much smaller version of what it was because of Afghanistan. They went bust, spending so many years and so much money and not winning in Afghanistan, but all of that money they spent, all of the lives they lost, same thing. But all you have to do is ask Russia, “What do you think?” Now I hear they going back in, not so fast. Everybody that’s gone in, hasn’t been so good. And you know what, we have to go in and we should go in when it’s right. And we now may have to be forced to go in because this person that is running our country made a horrific decision of taking all of our powerful military out.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (36:07)\n",
      "We may be forced to go in. And we may not be forced, but we may be forced to go in. And if you’re not prepared to go in, you’re never going to see those 45,000 people again. That I can tell you. If they don’t think you’re prepared to go in, you’re never going to see again, whether it’s 10 or 45,000 people, you’ll never see them again. All Joe Biden had to do was follow our plan. It’s like the border, all he had to do is go to the beach. He didn’t have to do anything. We had the tightest, most secure border. We built almost 500 miles of wall. He could have finished it in one month. Instead, he’s paying billions of dollars not to finish it. And I would have had it much earlier, but I got sued by the Democrats and Congress so much, took two and a half years for me to win the lawsuits. After we won all the lawsuits, we built it at a rapid pace. It was just about finished, helped us great. We set records, records at the border. All he had to do was go to the beach. Same thing here. All he had to do is follow our plan. That was conditional, so if they don’t follow it, then we start blasting them again. They didn’t want to be blasted. They were tired of being blasted. They were tired. They’re tough. Everybody’s tough. But you know what? We’re tougher, he just said it. But nobody would know it. Nobody would know it. When you look at what’s happening, nobody would know it. But we’re tougher, I’d like to explain that to Abdul and to everybody else.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (37:37)\n",
      "We’re much tougher. Please remember that. It’s hard for them to understand that now after watching this. Think of that, the soldiers have left. I could just see this, the leadership of the Taliban standing there, somebody walking up, “Sir, the soldiers have left Afghanistan.” He goes, “What?” “The soldiers have left.” And they’ve left all of their citizens behind and they’ve left $83 billion worth of equipment behind, including brand new Apache helicopters, thousands of Humvee vehicles with armor guard, equipment that nobody has ever even seen before, it was so sophisticated and good. So can you imagine these guys Abdul and his friends sitting there, that the United States soldiers, our military, has left.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (38:33)\n",
      "They walked in, they walked in and they took everything. It’s crazy. It’s crazy. I’ve never seen anything so stupid in my life. Somebody said, “Don’t say it, Sir. It’s not good.” I asked yesterday, I was with a group of people and there was a five year old child. And I explained the situation to the five year old child. They said, ” No, you shouldn’t do that, Sir, because the press won’t like it.” I said, “That’s okay. I don’t mind. The press doesn’t like anything I do.” They actually do like it, but they’ll never say it, okay. But I asked the child, “So what would you do,” after describing, “Would you leave the military until everything’s out, including the civilians and all of that incredible military equipment? Or would you have the military go out first?”\n",
      "Donald Trump: (39:31)\n",
      "“Sir, I’d leave the military in.” He was five. He said, “I’d leave the military in, get everything out first.” I said, “Thank you very much.” But they didn’t want me to tell that story. They thought it was not an appropriate story, but it’s true. This is a five year old kid, five or six year old kid. And this is what we’re stuck with. But when Biden took office, he foolishly tore up our really good plan. Again, not a plan, it’s conditions. We do this, we do this, we do this. If you don’t do these things, we’re not going to do it. And then we start dropping bombs all over the place and they say, “You know what? We’re going to do it. We’ve decided to do it.” No, we had a good understanding.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (40:19)\n",
      "They always hate it. Remember when I came in, Obama said, “The worst problem we have is North Korea, Kim Jong-un.” I said, “What’s the problem?” He said, “I think you’re going to go to war with North Korea.” I said, “Have you ever called him?” “No.” Actually, he called him 14 times and was not responded to, but he told me, “No,” but that wasn’t truthful. I said, “Would be good to talk to him, wouldn’t it, rather than nuclear war, wouldn’t it be nice?” Anyway, through a series of events, I did talk to him and it was nasty at the beginning, remember? He said, “We have a red button on my desk.” And I said, “I have a much bigger red button. And my red button works and yours doesn’t.” And anyway, it was very nasty. And then all of a sudden, it became a love fest. It became great, right?\n",
      "Donald Trump: (41:08)\n",
      "And I went to North Korea, went to South Korea, went across the line. We got along great. There was no nuclear catastrophe, but you got to be careful because he does not respect Joe Biden. And he does not respect any longer America. But I said, it’s good to speak to people. I stopped the pipeline in Russia. I stopped it. Nobody’s ever been tougher to Russia, but I got along great with President Putin. We had a great relationship. He said, “You’re killing me with this pipeline.” I said, “Look, not right, Germany shouldn’t have been doing that.” The European union takes tremendous advantage of us almost as bad economically as China.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (41:49)\n",
      "People say, “Oh, that’s a terrible thing to say.” I say, “Really, how many Chevrolets are in Beijing right now? Maybe none.” Okay. They won’t take our cars. They won’t take our farm products. They won’t take anything. And I was hitting them hard. And then the China virus came and it was a terrible period of time. But we did the greatest job. And because the base was so strong, what we did was so strong, our country is doing well. It’s going to be blown now with all the inflation and everything else that’s taking place. But we built such a strong foundation that our country is doing great. And other countries are doing horribly, horribly. Remember they used to use anything to hit us. When we got hit, I closed it to China, closed it to Europe, anything to hit us. But they’d say, “In South Korea, they’re doing so well.” South Korea is being decimated right now. “India is doing so well.” India is being decimated right now. We did a great job on that. The ventilators, the equipment that we got, the cupboards were all bare.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (42:50)\n",
      "Everything that we did, and then we developed a vaccine, three vaccines in three months, in nine months. And actually, I’ll tell you, it was three days less, three days less than nine months. And it’s great. And you know what? I believe totally in your freedoms, I do. But you got to do what you have to do, but I recommend, take the vaccines. I did it. It’s good. Take the vaccines, but you got… No, that’s okay. That’s all right. You got your freedoms. But I happened to take the vaccine. If it doesn’t work, you’ll be the first to know, okay. I’ll call up Alabama and say, “Hey, you know what?” But it is working. But you do have your freedoms. You have to keep, you have to maintain that. You have to maintain that. And you got to get your kids back to school. And the mask issue is interesting because Fauci said, “Masks are bad,” and now he’s a radical masker.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (43:47)\n",
      "Now he wants you to wear 15 different masks at one time. I don’t know. He also told me he was a great athlete. Then I saw him throw out a pitch at the baseball game. “I used to be a great athlete, Sir.” “You did, really? Oh, that’s good.” Then I watch him on television. That’s not [inaudible 00:44:04]. The ball almost went to first base, didn’t it? The issue here is not about whether to leave Afghanistan. The issue is Joe Biden’s staggering incompetence and gross negligence. He doesn’t know where the hell he is. You think, he’s running the government? He’s not running the government. Creating the greatest strategic humiliation that we’ve ever seen as a country. And it was something that we should’ve stopped and the general should have done something. They should have done something.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (44:37)\n",
      "They should have talked to him and said, “Look, Commander in Chief,” but you just couldn’t have done that. If he had that evacuate… If he just moved the people out, he should have done it and he should have done it first. He had to have done it first. Sometimes in life decisions are made and when those decisions are made, if they’re bad decisions, you’ve got to get away from them and you’ve got to get away from them fast. And if you don’t get away from them, you’re not going to have a country anymore. I said about elections, if we don’t have great elections, if we don’t have borders, if we don’t have the things that are being taken away from us, we’re not going to have a country anymore. And certainly, we’re not going to have a respected country anymore.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (45:22)\n",
      "With me in office, the Taliban would not have ever dreamt of capturing our airfield or parading around with our American weapons. Did you see all those guns they have? Who recognized those guns, because they’re same guns you had. We made them. There would have been no emergency embassy evacuation and no taking down of our flag. They took down our flag. Because we would have established clear lines that the Taliban would have never dared to cross. The problem with Biden is that our enemies are not afraid of him. They don’t respect him, our adversaries and our allies no longer trust him. They can’t trust him any longer. Remember he went back and he went to Europe and they didn’t know what the hell was going on. And they said, “What the heck.” We’re back. In other words, we’re back. Now you can continue to take advantage of us because Europe took advantage of us with NATO like nobody ever. I got Europe to pay $430 billion toward NATO. They would have never paid. For 15, 18 years, it was like this, the payment.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (46:35)\n",
      "And we’re protecting them. And some of them were totally delinquent. They didn’t pay. And I said, “You got to pay.” They said, “Sir, what would happen if we didn’t pay? Would you protect us?” I said, “If you didn’t pay, I would not recommend protecting you.” And it was amazing how fast that money came in, right? That money came in fast, 430. Started off with 130 billion. Billion, not million, billion. And then 430 billion came in very quickly. “We did a lot of good things with South Korea.” I said, “We protect you for nothing. You’ve got to pay. You’re a rich country. You make the boats, you make all of our television sets, which you took from us. Thank you very much. You make so many cars for us. You got to pay.” And they agreed. And they paid billions of dollars at my request. It wasn’t that easy. It took a little while, about two days. They agreed to pay billions of dollars, billions of dollars. And then I said, “Look, next year, wait till after the election. But you’re going to have to pay at least $5 billion.”\n",
      "Donald Trump: (47:39)\n",
      "“No, no, no. We will not pay.” I said, “Yes, you will pay. We have 32,000 soldiers in South Korea.” He said, “No, no, no. President Moon, nice man, good man.” But he said, “No,” which he should say. Why should he, when he was suckering us for so many years. So he said, “No, no.” I said, “You’re going to have to pay five billion.” But then the election result turned out different than what it should have, different from the real result. And I just heard, they made a deal with South Korea to pay a cost of living adjustment. You know what that is? Nothing. When the money I raised, it’s like nothing. And that’s, so they were, that was another country, I’m sure, that was extremely happy with the results. But I did a great job in protecting them. I think I’ve saved them from Kim Jong-un. So I don’t think they… I tell you what, a lot of people from South Korea come up to me and say, “Thank you very much, Sir.” I really, I think I saved them from Kim Jong-un because of the relationship I developed with Kim Jong-un.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (48:41)\n",
      "Biden is the most pathetic president. And look, he makes Jimmy Carter look great, right? Look at that man with that jacket. I love you, man. How many rallies have you come to? What number is this?\n",
      "Speaker 7: (48:55)\n",
      "30.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (48:56)\n",
      "Much more than that. He’s all… Much more. We have some women. Are they here tonight? North Carolina. Where are they? Where are they? We have some women, they’ve been to 96. I didn’t even know we did 96. I said, “How many?” “Sir, we’re up to about 96. I said, “I didn’t know we did that many.” But, look, this is a very unpleasant subject, but still, is this the greatest place to be in the world? And it’s [inaudible 00:49:25], right? It’s unpleasant to talk about it, but sometimes you have to think and talk about unpleasant things, but not only is it Biden and the embarrassment to the United States abroad. His radicalism and extremism is currently destroying our nation right here at home. And nobody understands that better than Alabama, nobody. Remember when Biden used to go and say he’s an Iowa and he’d say, “It’s great to be an Idaho.” Sir, you’re in Iowa.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (50:03)\n",
      "And he’d say, “It’s great to be an Idaho.” “Sir, you’re in Iowa.” He would do this all the time. He was in New Hampshire, “It’s great to be in Maine today.” “Sir, you’re in New Hampshire.” The worst was when he was in New York and he said it’s great to be in Florida. There were no palm trees. “Great to be in Florida,” he’d do it all the time. I’ve never done it yet. I’ve never done it, with all of them speeches I’ve made. I was just saying, because I said Alabama. But I know exactly, I didn’t have to think about it. It’s called Alabama. I love Alabama. I’ve always loved Alabama.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (50:37)\n",
      "And I’ve always said if that ever happens, you can forget about the rest of the night because the speech is a total disaster. In other words, “It’s great to be in South Carolina with you people tonight,” I’d say, if that ever happened it’s a disaster. You might as well just walk off the stage. Because you could be Winston Churchill, great speaker… You could be Winston Churchill, the great Winston Churchill, make an increment rest of the speech and it’s a disaster. The only difference is, if you make a speech, if he does it, which he does all the time in different forms, the press doesn’t cover it.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (51:14)\n",
      "He’s the only guy that didn’t get covered falling, walking up the stairs. The press didn’t cover it other than a couple internet covered it, I guess. Right? Do you think they would have covered it if I fell on the Air Force One? He fell three times. ” Down goes Frazier,” remember that? He kept going down and up, down and up. I said, “What the hell is going on here?” I was watching that. “Whats going on with our president?” And it wasn’t on one nightly news cast. I think I might’ve been on… I did the ramp, the long slippery ramp. I said, “General,” it was pouring out, pouring. I said, “General, this is a bad deal here. I got leather shoes on the bottom and I’m going to fall. I’m not going to let them…” So I walked down tiny little steps.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (52:05)\n",
      "“What’s wrong with the president?” The biggest story. I was so proud when I got down, I didn’t fall. I said, “General, I don’t want to grab you, but I may have to grab you.” Big, strong general, Commandant of West Point. You know I made my best speech at West Point that day. But then it was pouring, and when I went down the ramp and it was pure… Normally they have like some little grooves, nothing. It was like an ice skating rink. I think it was a trap. And I said, “General, this is not a good situation. That sucker looks slippery as hell. And I’m not going to allow them to tape me falling.” Remember Gerald Ford fell, that was not a good time. Some other bad things happened to presidents, not a good time. You can’t do that, you can’t let that happen. So what happened is they made that a big story. I was so proud of myself. I made my best speech and nobody talked about that speech. Someday, hopefully, they’ll go back and get the speech I made at the graduation of West Point two years ago.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (53:00)\n",
      "I’d love you to hear that speech. I called up the First Lady. I said, “First Lady, I just made a great speech.” She said, “You’re on television for the way you went down a ramp.” It’s all they talked about. But with him falling down the stairs, three times, he was down. No, he’s up! No he’s down again, Oh my God! No he’s up! He’s down again. He’s down for three times. You know, if that were a fight, they’d stop it. Right? If that were a fight.They would’ve stopped it, Mike. In a matter of mere months, Biden has thrown our southern border wide open. When I left office we handed the new administration the most secure border in US history and they turned it into the greatest border disaster in American history, probably anywhere in the world. You know, they’re emptying their prisons out into our country.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (53:49)\n",
      "And I’m not just talking about Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico. I’m talking about Middle Eastern countries. Yemen, people are coming in from Yemen. Our country will really be in trouble. We’ll really be in trouble.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (54:06)\n",
      "Under my administration we ended the ridiculous catch and release. You catch somebody, you find out they’re a criminal and you release them immediately into our country. We ended asylum fraud. We deported record numbers of criminal aliens. We negotiated historic agreements with Mexico and Central America to stop illegal immigration. And we built all of that wall that I just talked about.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (54:32)\n",
      "But we had a Stay in Mexico policy. “You can’t come into our country, I’m sorry. Stay in Mexico.” Biden ended it. He ended it. But you know what happened? Yesterday we won in court and a very wise judge said we’re allowed to have Stay in Mexico. Thank you, judge. Thank you, judge. Thank you very much. They use to stay in the United States and then you’d never find them again. You’d stay, and some of these people are seriously tough criminals.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (55:05)\n",
      "I achieved a 90% reduction in illegal border crossings. Think of that 90%, it was going to go much higher. And brought illegal immigration to a virtual halt. It was the lowest levels ever recorded and you could come into our country, but you had to come in legally. Finally, we did it, but we had a win a lot of court cases. Many of those court cases started against us by Democrats in Congress.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (55:29)\n",
      "Under the Trump administration our message was clear, if you try to come here illegally you will be caught, you will be detained and you will be immediately sent back home where you belong.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (55:44)\n",
      "And when people heard that… And they hear it, they’re genius, it’s genius. When people heard that and then they saw the results, because there wasn’t games, it was happening. They never came. They stopped. Remembered at the beginning with the caravans, we ended the caravans. But now the caravans are back at a level that nobody’s ever seen. Bigger, stronger, more powerful. It’s a disgrace.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (56:08)\n",
      "Now the radical left Democrats have surrendered our sovereignty to the coyotes and drug cartels, child smugglers, human traffickers, and they usually traffic in women. Biden stopped wall construction, instituted nationwide catch and release, wanted it back, and invited the entire world to make a mad dash for the USA when he said, “Come. You’re welcome.”\n",
      "Donald Trump: (56:35)\n",
      "I don’t know if he knew? Do people think this is a good thing, what happened? They’re destroying our country. Last month alone, border patrol, who we love apprehended a mind boggling 210,000 illegal border crosses. You can multiply that times 6, 7, 8 or 9 of the people that come in without getting caught. They say, you can use numbers like that.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (57:03)\n",
      "Record numbers are getting away and historic numbers are coming from outside Mexico and Central America from every corner all over the world. A lot of them coming in from the Middle East. At this rate, millions of illegal aliens will cross our border just this year alone. Millions. Millions of people, many of these people are hardened criminals, murderers. Again, think of this. Just think of this statement… They are emptying their jails into the United States.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (57:36)\n",
      "Think of that. A lot of people don’t know what that means. They are the toughest, meanest jails. They’re emptying them into the United States. This massive overcrowding on our border is a super spreader disaster that will bring new variants into our nation. And honestly far worse than variants, far worse.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (57:58)\n",
      "MS-13 is being replenished to levels never seen before. I brought MS-13 through ICE and Border Patrol out, by the thousands. Thousands. We were going into towns in Long Island, and these were brave warriors like law enforcement is, we have so much respect. And they’d go right into what they call a “nest” of a lot of these gang members, and they’d start fighting.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (58:26)\n",
      "All these guys that I know, my friends in the first row, I know every one of them very well. Not one of them would do this job. And if they did, they’d be knocked out in about two seconds. They wouldn’t do it well. They wouldn’t want to do it. ICE is, these are brilliant, great, tough, strong, but more important than anything, patriotic people.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (58:47)\n",
      "They would go into these towns and they would get these hardened criminals that are loaded up with weapons and they would get them the hell out of our country. It’s amazing what they did for us. And now they’re being treated horribly by this administration. Joe Biden is functionally abandoned ICE, shut down interior enforcement and turned our nation into a giant sanctuary for dangerous criminals.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (59:10)\n",
      "We have criminals coming in this country, nobody knows how bad it’s going to be. Watch, that’s another Trump prediction. In the Republican Party we believe our country should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (59:28)\n",
      "Under my administration, we found the gang members, drug dealers, and various MS-13 killers and we kicked… I mean quickly, we knock them out so fast nobody could believe it. Thousands! Thousands a year. And we quickly deported them or we put them behind bars where they belong. Sometimes they were so evil, so vicious we didn’t want to take a chance on bringing them back to their countries.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (59:55)\n",
      "And their countries didn’t want them, you know. You know that story. I’ve told that story. When I came in, we’d catch these people in Border Patrol, ICE, I’d meet with the top people. They’re incredible people. They’d say, “Sir, they won’t take the people.” I said, “What do you mean they won’t take them?” “They don’t want them back. They don’t want the gang members back. They don’t want the killers back. They won’t take them back.”\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:00:17)\n",
      "When we fly in with an airplane, they put planes on the runway so we can’t land, we have to come back.

      "Donald Trump: (01:00:34)\n",
      "I say, “Really? Do we give them any money every year?” This is early on, so I learned exactly what it was, but early on. You know, hadn’t done it too long, right? “Do we give them any money?” “Yes, sir!” “How much?” About $500 million a year, that’s a lot of money, right?\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:00:51)\n",
      "So I said, “Good. Stop payment immediately. No more money going to these countries. No more money going to these countries.” I immediately stopped all of this 500 million, little more than that, 500 million going to the three countries. And a day went by and I got a call from all three of the heads of those countries who I knew and know and respect. They’re smart. They’re very streetwise people. They’re very smart and very, very streetwise.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:01:20)\n",
      "“Mr. President, you stopped many millions of dollars from coming into Honduras and Guatemala and El Salvador. You stopped it from coming in, Mr. President, is there something we did wrong?”\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:01:33)\n",
      "“Yes. You’re not taking back people that came into our country illegally. You will not take them back.” “Oh, there must be some understanding, sir. We would love to have them back.” I said, “Congratulations, we’ll be sending lots of planes your way.” And we did, we got them all back and we still didn’t make the payment. I delayed that sucker a long time. We still didn’t make the payment, we waited a long time, but they took them all back.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:02:02)\n",
      "And then the other day I heard that Biden wants to give those countries $4 billion because he thinks that they’re going to spend the money on economic development. No, it’s going to go economic development into their bank accounts in Switzerland, okay? That’s the economic development we’re talking about.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:02:26)\n",
      "They want to give them $4 billion. They’re working on the paperwork right now. The money is going to be stolen. It’s going to be given to the cartels. It’s going to be given to the traffickers. It’s going to be kept by politicians. See, we only have honest politicians in our country, right? Like Mo. That’s true.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:02:49)\n",
      "We understand. And we’ve understood very much in America First that immigration security is national security. And that’s why we instituted the travel ban. Remember the travel ban? I took such heat where I was able to get people that came into our country from very tough countries… Very, very tough countries. And I was able to stop them from coming to our country because we didn’t want to have our stores blown up. We didn’t want to have buildings set on fire and death and destruction.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:03:21)\n",
      "So, we lost it in the lower court. We lost it in the second court. And then we won at the United States Supreme Court. And to show you how dishonest the press is, recently they wrote about it. They said, “He lost in court!” And they were right, at the lower court, but then I lost again. But then I won.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:03:39)\n",
      "I said, “You didn’t say I won.” “Well, you did loose.” In other words, technically they’re right, I lost in court. But I won and we have a travel ban. And without that travel ban, you would have some really bad, bad people in here from places in the world that are evil. And it was a great thing.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:03:55)\n",
      "I took a lot of heat over that travel ban. People said, “That’s not nice.” They all like to call it a “Muslim ban.” It wasn’t a Muslim ban, it was a travel ban from a lot of different countries that are bad and they send bad people to us. And because of the travel ban, we didn’t have to accept that. So it was a great success, but they try and make it look like it wasn’t very nice.\n",

      "We dramatically reduced refugee admissions and kept radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. Is that okay? I mean, is that okay? One of the first acts that Biden did after Mitch McConnell said, “We must get back to work. We have to get our country going. We have to approve him as the president.” Even though the evidence was staggering, you’ll see the evidence starting to come out. It’s already come out, far beyond what we need. By the way… Far, far, far beyond what we need.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:04:48)\n",
      "“We have to get back to our country and running our country,” Mitch McConnell. And the first thing that Biden did was sign 17 of the worst executive orders in the history of our country. And one of them Biden revoked that beautiful, wonderful travel ban and has surged refugee resettlement from the most dangerous countries in the world. The most dangerous terrorists in the world. They come into our country now with no problem, “Come on in. Love to have you.”\n",

      "The Afghanistan thing is so simple to understand because, when people watch that, people that weren’t even into watching political things on the news… But when people watch this, they understood it immediately about the military. Don’t take them out, leave it to last. Sort of like the captain of a ship. “Let’s jump off first before the passengers, I’m getting the hell out of here.” Right? That’s what it is. The captain is supposed to wait and watch and work.\n",

      "By the way, that’s 10 times more than I need to win, 10 times more. 200,000 from the voter roles and they did it, unfortunately, why didn’t they move them before the election? They removed them after the election. Oh, thank you very much. I appreciate it. They removed these names after the election was over. Approximately 20 times more than we needed.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:07:50)\n",
      "Earlier this month, it was revealed that in Georgia ballots were rejected by machines and illegally altered by hand to remove marks for Trump and instead cast votes for Joe Biden. You’ll see that coming in. You’re going to see many of it.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:08:06)\n",
      "In some states, you had a little thing, a little problem, more votes than voters. A little problem. Take a look at Detroit. “Sir, they have many more votes than they have voters.” Oh, that doesn’t sound so good, does it? Huh? And they needed just a little bit, just a little bit. Didn’t need all, didn’t need much of it.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:08:26)\n",
      "For example, in Nevada it was recently discovered that 15 out of the state’s 17 counties had more votes than voters in 2020. Think of that, Nevada run by Democrats. Yeah, I wonder how that happened?\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:08:41)\n",
      "In Arizona, 11,000 individuals are now listed as having voted who were not even on the roles the day after the election. They weren’t listed on the roles. None of the margins in the state, remember this, the margin was less than 11,000 substantially. So that was much more than we needed. That was just one of many categories.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:09:08)\n",
      "The Arizona auditors have also collected a sworn affidavit stating that county election workers abolished signature matching entirely. Okay, well that sounds reasonable. No signature. In other words, “Whose signature is it?” “We’re not allowed to match.” “Oh, that’s great.”\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:09:26)\n",
      "Maricopa County has refused to comply with an official subpoena to provide images of the envelopes, which would prove whether they indeed counted ballots with no signatures at all. Many of the ballots weren’t signed, they were just thrown in there.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:09:44)\n",
      "Finally, a recent trend analysis of all 50 states based on population growth, voter history and voter registration data by one of the most respected people in that industry. Somebody so respected, a military person, Captain Seth Keshel found over 8 million excess Biden votes. In other words, he had 8 million more votes that he’s supposed to have.\n",
      "Speaker 8: (01:10:13)\n",
      "Throw him in jail!\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:10:14)\n",
      "And his estimate is conservative, he considered it very conservative. And I believe he said he didn’t even go to the machines. This is without even looking at the machines. Remember I’m not the one trying to undermine American democracy. I am the one trying to save American democracy.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:10:43)\n",
      "The numbers speak for themselves. We got 12 million more votes than in 2016. I was told by the best pollsters in the world… Real pollsters, not the phony pollsters that are used by certain of the fake news media… If I got 1 million more votes I couldn’t lose. I got 12 million more votes, and we lost.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:11:09)\n",
      "You know, Obama the second time got millions fewer votes than he did the first time. He won. But I was told by the most talented pollsters, and polling is talent. Polling works, but not when it’s fraudulent polling. “Get 1 million votes, sir, you cannot lose. It’ll be an easy early evening.” We got 12 million votes and they said we lost, but we didn’t.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:11:33)\n",
      "We won 18 out of 19 bellwether counties, which is unprecedented. We flipped 15 House seats. Remember we were going to lose 25-35 House seats. Instead of losing 25 or 35, we won 15. It was a big evening. And you know why? Because, they came in on our coattails. That’s what happened. The Congressmen will tell you that. And women, they will tell you that.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:12:02)\n",
      "And did not lose a single Republican incumbent in Congress. Think of that. For the first time… Congressmen, we never think of that. This was in decades and decades, we didn’t lose one seat. You know why? I hate to say it, because of me. It’s because of me.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:12:24)\n",
      "Despite the pandemic, 56%, this was a record, of Americans… This is during the pandemic… believed that they were better off in 2020 than they were in 2016 when I assumed office. Think of that, 56% is a record. And we had a pandemic going. A majority of Americans, 55%, want audits of the votes. They want audits. And they want the forensic audits, they don’t want the bullshit audits. And 88% of the American citizens, of our citizens, of our great people are demanding voter ID.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:13:20)\n",
      "Thank you. Here tonight is someone who has fought harder than anyone else in Congress to expose the election fraud, he is really a fighter, and to defend the integrity of our elections. And I have to say it, I just can’t imagine him losing. He’s got courage. He’s an honest guy. He’s an honest guy. And that gives him the courage. Your next us Senator from Alabama, Mo Brooks. Thank you.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:13:54)\n",
      "I know Mo spoke, but come up and say just a quick word Mo. He’s doing very poorly in the polls, he’s only up at about 90%. Come on, Mo.\n",
      "Mo Brooks: (01:14:09)\n",
      "Thank you Mr. President, and future President of the United States of America. I’m pleased to announce the second coming of President Donald J. Trump.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:14:30)\n",
      "Go get them Mo. Thank you Mo. Mo is a fearless warrior for your sacred right to vote. And so many other things, he’s going to be an incredible Senator and we’re proud of him. And we’re proud of my cherish, your cherished, by my cherished Alabama. I feel like… I don’t know, The relationship. The relationship has been so strong. Right at the beginning, before I knew anything, I just knew we had a thing called common sense together. Thank you.\n",
      "Speaker 8: (01:15:02)\n",
      "We love you! We love you!\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:15:02)\n",
      "Thank you.\n",

      "We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:15:17)\n",
      "… everybody. Thank you. I love you too, but it is true. Early on I said, “How are we doing in Alabama?” “Sir, you’re up about 45 points.” This was before I knew any, I didn’t know what the hell it even meant. “45 points. That sounds good.” We’re up at the numbers that nobody’s ever seen before. We’ve never gone down, now we’re up higher than we ever were. And you also have somebody that is unbelievable. Unbelievable. He happens to be now a Senator. He was an unbelievable football coach, Tommy Tuberville. Tommy, stand up, Tommy. Where is Tommy? Where’s Tom? I love Tommy. Where the hell is he? Where is he? He’s here? The hell of a crowd. I want to tell you, this crowd goes so far back. See the cameras. We shouldn’t give that to the media because all they do is they block the view and they don’t say the truth, anyway.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:16:17)\n",
      "This crowd, see what this is? Goes hundreds of yards behind those cameras. Look at that. Man. Tommy, I love to see Tommy. I love Tommy. He’s doing a great job. I said, “Tommy, you you’re running for Senate.” And he did a good job. He was a natural and he was a rah-rah coach, but he was a great coach. I asked Urban Myers, “How good a coach was Tommy Tuberville?” He said, “He beat me twice. He’s the only one that beat me twice.” But I said, “Tommy, you beat Alabama six times.” I said, “How can you possibly expect the people of Alabama to vote for you?” He said, “Sir, because I gave them a coach named Sabin. Because of me they have…”\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:17:11)\n",
      "I said, “Tommy, that’s the coolest answer I’ve ever heard.” And you voted him in and he’s been a great Senator. He’s been phenomenal. Thank you very much. Thank you, Tommy. Thank you very much. Credible guy, credible guy. And he’s got that look of a Senator. Doesn’t he? Not that looks matter. I always say looks don’t matter. You know, nowadays looks don’t matter, but he still got the look of a Senator. He’s doing a great job. Lieutenant governor, Will Ainsworth. Will, thank you, Will, great job. Nice meeting you backstage.\n",

      "Alabama Attorney General, Steve Marshall. Steve? Thank you, Steve. Thank you. Thank you very much. Representatives Jerry Carl, Barrymore, Gary Palmer. Robert, where’s Robert? Robert Aderholt. He’s been another one. Oh, and one of my favorite people. She’s so smart. I hope she’s around. I hope she’s around. She is an incredible woman. She’s a brilliant woman. Doesn’t get credit for it, but we all know about that stuff. Marjorie Taylor Green, Marjorie. Where is she? She’s great. She is great. She’s a warrior.\n",

Greg, thank you very much. Thank you. State Senator Garland [inaudible 01:19:11]. Garland, thank you. State Representative Andrew Sirall. A man who’s done a fantastic job, Sheriff Matt Gentry.

      "Alabama GOP chair, this guy is amazing. You know what you raised tonight? A record in the history of the Republican party. And I think also in the history of the Democrat party, if we can say that. You raised $1.2 million. And I didn’t ask for anything, I should have. I made a mistake. Marjorie, I made a mistake. You know, normally I’ll say, all right, we’ll raise money, but you take half. We take half. We put it into my campaign. We put it… I just said the hell with it. Alabama is so good. Keep the whole damn thing. He raised $1.2 million. John Wall, John? Great job, great job, John.\n",

      "It’s a record. A patriot, a wonderful man, a man who puts his guts into everything. A man that they don’t treat properly. He’s smart. He loves this country so much. He’s willing to die for this country. I watched him over the last week at his symposium, which was really amazing. Some of the people he had were incredible, incredible people. Mike Lindell. Mike?\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:20:48)\n",
      "It’s true. I’ll tell you true. It’s true He had some people up there really… I mean, there was scientists, they were political scientists and beyond, and they were incredible. What they said and what they understand. Also, want to thank for covering us. So incredibly well, two wonderful young people with unbelievable futures, Natalie Harp and Christina Bob. Did you ever hear them? They are unbelievable. Natalie Harp and Christina Bob, two incredible people. Thank you. Thank you very much for the job you do. Both of you. Unbelievable, an unbelievable job. What a good future you have.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:21:45)\n",
      "Under our administration, we’ve accomplished more in four short years than most presidents dream of accomplishing in eight years. We passed the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country. Record setting regulation cuts. Nobody came close. Fair and reciprocal trade deals. We got rid of NAFTA. One of the worst deals ever made. Now we have the USMCA and we stood up to China like never before. We charged them tens of billions of dollars of tariffs. We never took in 25 cents from China. We built the greatest economy in the history of the world. And then we did it again. We had to do it twice and now it’s being destroyed, rapidly destroyed by what they’re doing with inflation and other things. We completely rebuilt the United States military. We created Space Force and we selected Huntsville, Alabama as the new headquarters of the US Space Command.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:22:50)\n",
      "I made a lot of enemies. I’ve made so many and a lot of states wanted it, but we put it in Alabama and that was not an easy one. You think this stuff is easy. It’s not so easy. By contrast, no administration in history has gotten off to a worst start then the Biden administration. There’s never been anything like this. And I thought about that statement before it happened with the disaster that we’re witnessing in Afghanistan. Joe Biden is a failed president. He will always be a failed president. He’s ushered in one calamity after another. When I left office, I handed Biden three vaccines to end the pandemic in record time, as I said, and yet under his leadership, the virus is surging back. Could you imagine if I were president and the virus was surging back? She said it wouldn’t be. It wouldn’t come back. Yeah, that one’s actually tougher than the Taliban. I must be honest with you. But he’s reimposing mask mandates and threatening new restrictions on the American people meanwhile. Many, many new restrictions. Meanwhile, 21% of migrant youth who recently crossed the border reportedly have COVID and they don’t have to do anything. They don’t have to wear masks. They don’t have to go through testing. They don’t have to do anything. And the country is being infected by what’s coming over the border. And not only with COVID. Biden canceled the Keystone XL pipeline. And as I said, it’s okay for Russia, but no good for us. Remember when he said we will not approve the America first agenda. I said, that’s a killer statement. Isn’t it? But he actually believes that, America first, the greatest I think we’ve ever had, the greatest statement as to what we want to do with our country. And he said, “We are not for America first.” I said, did anybody actually tell him to say that?\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:25:03)\n",
      "He attacked oil and gas workers here in America and caused gas prices to skyrocket, yet now he is begging OPEC for more production to please send energy our way. Please send oil gas to our country. And six months ago we had so much, we didn’t know what the hell to do with it. Unbelievable. He shut a lot of it down, had nothing to do with the environment. It’s called an environmental hoax. He did the exact opposite. I broke OPEC and I broke the cartel. You saw what was happening. We actually had a moment in time where oil prices went down per barrel to minus $37. In other words, if you took a barrel of oil, they gave you $37. I told my people, why didn’t you do that? We would’ve gotten paid to take the oil. That was too much because it was going to destroy our industry. But we did fill up the national oil reserves that were empty for years. And we filled them up with very cheap oil. And now Biden wants to use that to supplement what we have. We shouldn’t do that.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:26:17)\n",
      "We achieved American energy independence, and we turned America into the number one energy super power in the world. We were bigger than Saudi Arabia by a lot. We were bigger than Russia by a lot. And now we’re going back to them asking them for help. Do you believe this? Biden and the radical Democrats are also pushing a $4.7 trillion spending Bonanza that is nothing but a down payment on the socialist Green New Deal. Build your buildings. Please don’t put windows in your building. That’s one of the ones that we don’t want windows to be in the building. And if they are, they want them to be very small. Take the buildings down in New York and build new buildings with smaller windows.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:27:05)\n",
      "Between the phony infrastructure bill and the budget proposal, their package would abolish the suburbs, totally abolish. They said I lost people in the suburbs. I’m the one that got them to stop building horrible low-income housing that was going to destroy the suburbs. And they’re saying that I didn’t do well in the suburbs. I think I did great in the suburbs. I think the women in suburbs voted for Donald Trump. That’s what I think. I do think. We had a rigged election. They give Congress unchecked authority to raise your taxes. You will be getting the biggest tax increase in history if they’re allowed to do what they are trying to do, allow the government to try taxing America drivers by the mile. They want to tax you by the mile and grant a backdoor mass amnesty to illegal aliens. The radical Democrat party and their media allies are completely and totally corrupt. The same people who want you to believe there was no election fraud are the ones who said there was no spying in my campaign.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:28:16)\n",
      "Remember, they spied my campaign? I said, “They’re spying on my campaign,” and the world went crazy. I thought it was just an innocent statement because we know they’re dishonest. The world went crazy when I said they’re spying and it turned out that to be true. They perpetrated the Russia hoax. They framed General Flynn. They conducted the Mueller witch hunt, never ending Mueller witch hunt. They’re continuing to do it with very dishonest, highly political prosecutors, all over the place. They’re using justice to go after Republicans. And we can’t let that happen, because again, we’re not going to have a country left. And they pushed the impeachment hoax number one and impeachment hoax number two, who ruthlessly smeared Brett Kavanaugh. Do you remember how they went after Brett Kavanaugh? He was with this one. He was with that one. He wasn’t with any of them. And they knew that, but you know, they’re trying to scare our Supreme Court.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:29:22)\n",
      "And they’re trying to scare people like Bill Barr and others. By going after him, they try and scare him because they say they’re going to pack the court or they’re going to impeach Bill Barr. And you know, it changes some people. It really does. It changes them. It scares them. They don’t want that to happen. They talk about, they want to impeach Kavanaugh. You know what they want to impeach him for? Nothing. He didn’t do anything wrong. In fact, the opposite, they did everything wrong. They were total dishonest people. One of the most horrendous hearings that anyone’s seen, they covered up the origins of the China virus. And they censored all information about Joe Biden and Hunter Biden and all of the corruption in that family.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:30:06)\n",
      "Just recently, it was revealed that Google rewrote its whole program. You saw that, in order to target Donald Trump, they targeted me. And yet, we still got 75 million votes. How the hell did we do that? But really the number wasn’t 75 million. I believe the number was many, many, many millions more. You know, it’s funny. I have a rally like this that goes way the hell back. By the way, it’s starting to rain. I will prove to you it’s my hair.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:30:50)\n",
      "But everyone in here knows that the radical left will stop at nothing to destroy the America we love. We’re not going to let it happen. All of you in Alabama and with conservative patriots like Mo Brooks and others and all of the names I mentioned are fighting for us in Washington. And I have never been more confident that we will defeat the radical left. And we have to. We don’t have a choice. These are vicious people and they stick together. They don’t have Mitt Romney and these guys that go off on their own, they don’t have people like that. Little Ben Sasse. He said nothing. They don’t have people like this. They have people that stick together. I respect them for that, but I don’t respect them for trying to destroy our country.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:31:39)\n",
      "With a Republican Congress, we will fight for more jobs for American families, fair trade for American workers. And we’ve done more on trade deals than any other administration in the history of our country, including the China deal, which I don’t even talk about it anymore because of COVID but the China deal has made our farmers rich. Our farmers and manufacturers have never done better. And more American factories, forging more products stamped with that very beautiful phrase, made in the USA.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:32:18)\n",
      "So in conclusion, our movement is up against some of the most sinister forces and entrenched interests that anyone can even imagine. But no matter how big our way of life, no matter how big our country or how powerful they may seem, you must never forget this nation does not belong to them. This nation belongs to you. This is your home. This is your heritage. And our magnificent American Liberty is your God given right. The citizens of the United States of America will not be dictated to and talked down to by incompetent politicians, corrupt tyrants, left-wing bullies, or socialist bureaucrats in Washington, DC, a place that I got to know very, very well.\n",

      "We are descended from the heroes and the patriots, the pioneers and the legends who tame the great wilderness, who settled this vast continent and who laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, and poured out their blood, sweat, and tears to build this country into the greatest-\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:33:55)\n",
      "… we cannot climb. There is no summit we cannot reach. And there is no challenge we cannot meet. We are Americans and the future belongs to us. We’re going to have a great future. We are going to turn this mess around. This is a horrible thing that’s happening to our country. We’re left out all over the world. We’re not going to be left at anymore. This is a horrible, horrible thing. And it’s going to go on for awhile, but we’ve got to end it. We cannot let this happen. They’re destroying our country. We will not bend. We will not break. We will not yield. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back down. We will never, ever surrender.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:34:50)\n",
      "My fellow Americans, our movement is far from over. In fact, our fight has only just begun. In the history of our country, there has never been a movement like this. There’s never been anything like it. People run for the Senate. They do okay. They lose. They win a couple of votes and they’re national heroes for 50 years. They’re on television, talking. People running for president and they come in second, third, or fourth in one primary. And they’re national heroes all of a sudden. We, not me. We ran for president and we won 32 states. And then we did better the second time, much better the second time, much, much better. Somebody from the fake news media said, “Sir, what was the difference between 2016 and 2020?” I said, “Well, the difference was that in 2020, we did much, much better. The rallies were bigger. The enthusiasm was more.”\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:35:56)\n",
      "Because in 2016, I told you what we were going to do, but it was talk. In 2020, you knew that I did it. So we had a much better, but we were cheated. And it was rigged. We were cheated, but there’s never been a movement like this. And you know, it’s funny. I say it a lot. And with the fake news, look at all of them back there, the fake news is back there. They never ever question it. If I say something that’s close to wrong, it’s headline news. But I say, this is the greatest rally in the history of our country, this is the greatest movement in the history of our country. There’s never been anything like it.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:36:41)\n",
      "And it’s probably the greatest movement in the history of our world. It’s probably, this movement. Call it, make America great again, call it America first, call it what you will. I believe it’s the greatest movement probably in the history of the world. It’s just starting. It’s just starting. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. So with love of our nation, swelling in our hearts, and it does swell in your hearts. That’s why you’re standing here in the rain, listening to this person. You’re saying, “Darling, it’s raining. Let’s go home.” But nobody is leaving all the way back hundreds and like football fields behind, football fields. “Darling, it’s raining,” but they say, “We’re not going home because we love our country.”\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:37:40)\n",
      "But with swelling in our hearts, the spirit of America is stirring ourselves. And I say these words to you, and you’ve heard these words before, in some cases many times before, we will make America powerful again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America, despite what you’re seeing today so sad and so pathetic, we will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And you know what it is, we will make America great again. Thank you Alabama. God bless you all. Thank you. Thank you very much.\n",

      "Well, thank you very much. And hello, CPAC. Do you miss me yet? Do you miss me yet? A lot of things going on.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:36)\n",
      "There’s so many wonderful friends, conservatives and fellow citizens in this room and all across our country. I stand before you today to declare that the incredible journey we’ve begun together, we went through a journey like nobody else. There’s never been a journey like it. There’s never been a journey so successful. We began it together four years ago, and it is far from being over. We’ve just started.\n",
      "Crowd: (02:04)\n",
      "USA USA USA USA.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (02:11)\n",
      "Our movement of proud, hardworking, and you know what? This is the hardest working people, hard working American Patriots is just getting started. And in the end we will win. We will win.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (02:29)\n",
      "We’ve been doing a lot of winning as we gather this week, we’re in the middle of a historic struggle for America’s future, America’s culture, and America’s institutions, borders, and most cherished principles. Our security, our prosperity, and our very identity as Americans is at stake, like perhaps at no other time.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (02:56)\n",
      "So no matter how much the Washington establishment and the powerful, special interests may want to silence us, let there be no doubt. We will be victorious. And America will be stronger and greater than ever before.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (03:18)\n",
      "I want to thank my great friends, Matt and Mercedes Schlep. Matt, thank you. Thank you. Mercedes, thank you very much. And the American Conservative Union for hosting this extraordinary event. They’re talking about it all over the world, Matt. I know you don’t like that, but that’s okay, all over the world.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (03:39)\n",
      "I also want to pay my love and respect to the great Rush Limbaugh who is watching closely and smiling down on us. He’s watching and he’s loving it and he loves Catherine. Catherine, thank you for being here, so great. Thank you Catherine. He loved you, Catherine. I will tell you that. Fantastic. Thank you Catherine very much.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (04:15)\n",
      "To each and every one of you here at CPAC, I am more grateful to you than you will ever know. We’re gathered this afternoon to talk about the future of our movement, the future of our party, and the future of our beloved country. For the next four years, the brave Republicans in this room will be at the heart of the effort to oppose the radical Democrats, the fake news media, and their toxic cancel culture. Something new to our ears, cancel culture. And I want you to know that I’m going to continue to fight right by your side. We will do what we’ve done right from the beginning, which is to win. We’re not starting new parties. They kept saying, he’s going to start a brand new party. We have the Republican party. It’s going to unite and be stronger than ever before. I am not starting a new party. That was fake news, fake news.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (05:22)\n",
      "No. Wouldn’t that be brilliant? Let’s start a new party and let’s divide our vote so that you can never win. No, we’re not interested in that. No we have tremendous, Mr. McLaughlin just gave me numbers that nobody’s ever heard of before, more popular than anybody. That’s all of us. It’s all of us. Those are great numbers. And I want to thank you very much. Those are incredible numbers. I came here and he was giving me 95%, 97%, 92%. I said, they’re great. And I want to thank everybody in this room and everybody all throughout the country, throughout the world, if you want to really know that. Thank you though. Thank you.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (06:02)\n",
      "We will be united and strong like never before. We will save and strengthen America. And we will fight the onslaught of radicalism, socialism, and indeed it all leads to communism once and for all. That’s what it leads to. You’ll be hearing more and more about that as we go along. But that’s what it leads to. You know that. We all knew that the Biden administration was going to be bad. But none of us even imagined just how bad they would be and how far left they would go. He never talked about this. We would have those wonderful debates. He would never talk about this. We didn’t know what the hell he was talking about actually.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (06:48)\n",
      "His campaign was all lies. Talked about energy, I thought I said, “This guy actually, he’s okay with energy.” He wasn’t okay with energy. He wants to put you all out of business. He’s not okay with energy. He wants windmills, the windmills. The windmills that don’t work when you need them. Joe Biden has had the most disastrous first month of any president in modern history. That’s true. Already the Biden administration has proven that they are anti jobs, anti-family, anti borders, anti energy, anti-women, and anti science. In just one short month, we have gone from America first to America last. You think about it, right? America last. There’s no better example than the new and horrible crisis on our Southern border. We did such a good job. It was all worked. Nobody’s ever seen anything that we did. And now he wants it all to go to hell. When I left office just six weeks ago, we had created the most secure border in us history.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (08:06)\n",
      "We had built almost 500 miles of a great border wall that helped us with these numbers because once it’s up, they used to say, “A wall doesn’t work.” Well, you know what I’ve always said, walls and wheels. Those are two things that will never change. The wall has been amazing. It’s been incredible and little sections of it to complete, They don’t want to complete it. They don’t want to complete little sections in certain little areas. They don’t want to complete. But it’s had an impact that nobody would have even believed. It’s amazing considering that the Democrats’ number one priority was to make sure that the wall would never, ever get built, would never, ever happen, would never get financed. We got it financed. We ended catch and release, ended asylum fraud, and brought illegal crossings to historic lows. When illegal aliens trespass across our borders, they were properly caught, detained and sent back home. And these were some rough customers. I want to tell you some rough customers were entering our country.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (09:16)\n",
      "It took them the new administration only a few weeks to turn this unprecedented accomplishment into self-inflicted humanitarian and national security disaster by recklessly eliminating our border, security measures, controls, all of the things that we put into place. Joe Biden has triggered a massive flood of illegal immigration into our country, the likes of which we have never seen before. They’re coming up by the tens of thousands. They’re all coming to take advantage of the things that he said that’s luring everybody to come to America. And we’re one country. We can’t afford the problems of the world, as much as we’d love to. We’d love to help. But we can’t do that. So they’re all coming because of promises and foolish words.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (10:11)\n",
      "Perhaps worst of all, Joe Biden’s decision to cancel border security has single-handedly launched a youth migrant crisis that is enriching child smugglers, vicious criminal cartels, and some of the most evil people on the planet. You see it every day, just turn on the news. You’ll see it every day. Under my administration, we stopped the child smugglers. We dismantle the criminal cartels. We greatly limited drug and human trafficking to a level that nobody actually thought was possible. And the wall helped us a lot. And we protected vulnerable people from the ravages of dangerous predators. And that’s what they are dangerous, dangerous predators.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (10:58)\n",
      "But the Biden administration has put the vial coyotes back in business and it has done so in a very, very big way. Under the new administration, catch and release has been restored. Can you imagine? We work so hard, catch, you know where that is? You catch them, you take their name, they may be killers. They may be rapists. They may be drug smugglers. You take their name and you release them into our country. We did the opposite.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (11:29)\n",
      "We not only didn’t release them, we had them brought back to their country. Illegal immigrants are now being apprehended and released along the entire Southern border, just the opposite of what it was two months ago. They weren’t coming because they couldn’t get in. Once they think they can get in, they’re coming. And they are coming at levels that you haven’t even seen yet, by the hundreds of thousands, by the millions they’ll be coming.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (11:54)\n",
      "The Biden administration is now actively expediting the admission of illegal migrants, enabling them to lodge frivolous asylum claims and admitting them by the thousands and thousands and thousands a day, crowded together in unsanitary conditions, despite the ongoing economic and public health crisis, COVID-19, or as I call it, the China virus.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (12:26)\n",
      "There’s no masks. There’s no double mask. That was a new one that came out two weeks ago. First Fauci said, “You don’t need masks, no masks, no good. No, no.” Then all of a sudden, you want them; and now he wants double masks. No social distancing, no nothing, no nothing. And together, and it’s sad actually. And it’s sad for them. And it sad for our country, what the Biden administration is doing to push young migrants into the hands of human traffickers and coyotes is dangerous, immoral, and indefensible, hard to believe it’s happening. Biden has failed in his number one duty as chief executive enforcing America’s laws. This alone should be reason enough for Democrats to suffer withering losses in the midterms and to lose the White House decisively four years from now.\n",
      "Crowd: (13:28)\n",
      "USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (13:59)\n",
      "Actually, as you know, they just lost the White House. But it’s one of those things. But who knows, who knows? I may even decide to beat them for a third time. Okay? For a third time. True. Joe Biden defunded the border wall and stopped all future construction, even on small open sections that just needed to be finished up routine little work, it’s already been bought. Wait until the contractors get to them. And they say, “No, it costs us much more money not to finish this small section than if we finished it.” That’s going to be nice. Wait until you see those bills start pouring in.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (15:01)\n",
      "He revoked the executive order cracking down on deadly sanctuary cities. He has effectively ordered a shutdown of ICE, halting virtually all deportations, everyone, murderers, everybody, no more. Let’s not deport people and restricting our law enforcement professionals. And they are great professionals. You have many of them represented here today, from conducting almost any immigration enforcement of any kind. The Biden policy of releasing criminals into the US interior is making America into a sanctuary nation where criminals, illegal immigrants, including gang members and sex offenders are set free into American communities.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (15:45)\n",
      "They have no idea who’s coming up. And remember with the caravans, these countries, not only the three of them, but many, many countries all over the world. They’re not giving us their best and their finest, because they’re intelligent. They’re not giving us their best and their finest. Remember I said that. I said that a long time ago, when I made the first remarks, when I came down the escalator with our great future first lady who says, hello, who loves you as much as I love you. But I said that a long time ago. And we turned out to be 100% correct.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (16:29)\n",
      "Biden’s radical immigration policies aren’t just illegal. They’re immoral. They’re heartless. And they are a betrayal of our nation’s core values. It’s a terrible thing that’s happening.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (16:43)\n",
      "The Republican party must hold Joe Biden and the Democrats accountable. They ripped up the diplomatic agreements we negotiated with Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to shut down illegal immigration. They got a fortune, they got paid $500 million a year. When I came into office, those countries were refusing to take back illegal alien gang members, including MS 13, the most vicious probably of them all. No matter where you go in the world, MS 13, they do things that even the worst don’t think about. So I asked how much do we pay these countries? How much do we pay them? Sir, we pay them approximately $ 500 million a year. It’s a lot of money.\n",

      "I mean, it’s peanuts compared to the way other countries rip us off, but that’s a lot of money. I said, “Okay, we aren’t going to pay them anymore because they wouldn’t take back the criminals.” And this was true with the Obama administration. It was true for many, many years. So we’d catch a murderer. We’d want to bring them back to Guatemala, or Honduras, or El Salvador. They wouldn’t take them back. “No, we don’t want them.” We’d fly them in. They wouldn’t let the plane land. We’d bus them in. They wouldn’t let the buses get anywhere near the border.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (18:08)\n",
      "And I said, “We’re not going to pay them anymore.” So after I said that, and I stopped payment, like a term that we use in the world of business, let’s stop payment. So we stopped payment. They were delinquent. We stopped payment and they very quickly came to the table and we made a deal, very quick deal. We still kept the money. We still didn’t pay because… Or we made a deal.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (18:38)\n",
      "And when illegal aliens came across our border, they were rapidly deported and lovingly accepted by those countries from where they came. And it worked out great. So now they accept the people and that we ultimately got along very well with those countries, those three countries and many countries throughout the world, because they respected us again. They didn’t respect us. They couldn’t believe what they were getting away with. But now, Joe Biden has wrecked this great deal, wrecked it. And they’re already doing what they were doing before and they’re taking the money. And that’s just a small portion of what’s going on.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (19:18)\n",
      "To top it all off, the Biden people are pushing a bill that would grant mass amnesty for millions of illegal aliens while massively expanding chain migration. That’s where you come in and everybody comes in, your grandmother, your father, your mother, your brother, your cousins. They come in so easily. So, so crazy. So crazy. It even requires that the US government provide a legal border crosses with taxable funded lawyers, lawyers, everybody need a good lawyer? You can’t have one. They get the lawyers, they get lawyers. They’re probably very good too.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (19:55)\n",
      "The Democrat immigration bill is a globalist corp. You take a look at the corporatist, big tech attack on hardworking citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed. And Republicans must ensure that it never is allowed to become federal law, which is what they want to do.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (20:18)\n",
      "We must stand tall in the party. We have to do this. We have to stand tall as the party for law abiding Americans and others, when they’re in our country. Border security is just one of the many issues on which the new administration has already betrayed the American people. He didn’t talk about this stuff. I debated him. He wasn’t talking about this. What he signed with those executive orders, they weren’t things that were discussed. We didn’t know all about him and the press because they’re fake news. They’re the fakest fakers there are.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (20:56)\n",
      "The press refused to ask the questions. And when I asked the questions on television, on the debate, Chris Wallace, in this case, and others refused to let him answer. They refused to let them answer the questions. Maybe we could have found something. Or if the media did its job, which they don’t, they’re callous indifference to working family is equally clear when it comes to the critical matter of getting America’s children back to school. And they must get back and get back right now, right now, crazy. Terrible. Terrible.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (21:49)\n",
      "The Biden administration is actually bragging about the classroom education they are providing to migrant children on the border. While at the same time, millions of American children are having their futures destroyed by Joe Biden’s anti-science school closures. Think of it. We’re educating students on the border, but our own people, children of our citizens, citizens themselves are not getting the education that they deserve. There’s no reason whatsoever why the vast majority of young Americans should not be back in school immediately. The only reason that most parents do not have that choice is because Joe Biden has sold out America’s children to the teacher’s unions.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (22:48)\n",
      "His position is morally inexcusable. You know that. Joe Biden has shamefully betrayed America’s youth. And he is cruelly keeping our children locked in their homes, no reason for it whatsoever. They want to get out. They’re cheating the next generations of Americans out of the future that they deserve. And they do deserve this future. They’re going to grow up and they’re going to have a scar.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (23:14)\n",
      "It’s a scandal of the highest order. And one of the most graven acts by any president in our lifetimes. It’s the teacher’s union, it’s the votes and it shouldn’t happen. And nobody has more respect for teachers than I do. And I’ll bet you, a lot of the people within that union, they agree with everything I’m saying. Even the New York Times is calling out the Democrats. The mental and physical health of these young people is reaching a breaking point. Tragically, suicide attempts have skyrocketed and student depression is now commonplace and at levels that we’ve never seen before.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (23:53)\n",
      "The Democrats now say we have to pass their $1.9 trillion boondoggle to open schools, but a very small part of it has to do with that. You know where it’s going, it’s going-\n",
      "Donald Trump: (24:03)\n",
      "Well, part of it has to do with that, you know where it’s going, it’s going to bail out badly run Democrats, that is so much of it. But billions of dollars for schools remain unspent from the COVID relief bills that were passed last year. So on behalf of the moms, dads, and children of America, I call on Joe Biden to get the schools open and get them open now. They’re a great thing to do. When I left office and we’re very proud of this because this was something that they said could not be done. The FDA said it, everybody said it. Any article you read said it couldn’t be done. It would be years and years, I handed the new administration what everyone is now calling a modern day medical miracle. Some say, it’s the greatest thing to happen in hundreds of years, two vaccines produced in record time with numerous others on the way, including the Johnson and Johnson vaccine that was approved just yesterday.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (25:15)\n",
      "And therapeutic relief also, if you’re sick, we have things now that are incredible. What has taken place over the last year under our administration would have taken any other precedent at least five years. And we got it done in nine months. Everyone says five years, oh, five years.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (25:40)\n",
      "Can you imagine if you had to go through what all of the countries of the world who are now getting the vaccine or soon will be getting it from various companies, but can you imagine if all of those countries had to go through what they’ve been going through over the last year? You’d lose hundreds of millions of people. I pushed the FDA like they have never been pushed before. They told me that loud and clear. They have never been pushed like I pushed them. I didn’t like them at all, but once we got it done, I said, I now love you very much. What the Trump administration has done with vaccines has in many respects, perhaps saved large portions of the world. Not only our country, but large portions of the world.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (26:38)\n",
      "Not only did we push the FDA far beyond what the bureaucrats wanted to do. We also put up billions and billions of dollars, 10 billion to produce the vaccines before we knew they were going to work. It was called a calculated bet or a calculated risk. We took a risk because if we didn’t do that, you still wouldn’t have the vaccines. You wouldn’t have them for a long time. So think of that, we took this bet. We made a bet because we thought we were on a certain track, but you’d be starting to make them right now. It’d be a long time before you ever saw. It takes 60 to 100 days to manufacture and inspect new doses. And that means that 100% of the increased availability that we have now was initiated by our administration. 100%. In fact, the director of National Institutes of Health, Francis Collins, he’s Fauci’s boss, actually, I think he’s a Democrat too, by the way, recently said that our operation warp speed was absolutely breathtaking and that the Trump administration deserves full credit, which we do. And as conservatives and Republicans, never forget that we did it. Never let them take the credit because they don’t deserve the credit. They just followed now, they’re following our plan, but this has been something that they really call, they call it an absolute miracle. Joe Biden is only implementing the plan that we put in place. And if we had an honest media, which we don’t, they would say it loud and clear. By the time I left that magnificent house at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, almost 20 million Americans had already been vaccinated. 1.5 million doses were administered on my final day alone. 1.5 million in a day. Yet Biden said just a few days ago that when he got here, meaning The White House, there was no vaccine. He said, there’s no vaccine. Oh, good. Say it again, Joe. Now I don’t think he said that, frankly, in a malicious way. I really don’t. I actually believe he said that because he didn’t really know what the hell was happening.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (29:28)\n",
      "Never let them forget. This was us. We did this. And the distribution is moving along, according to our plan. And it’s moving along really well. We had the military, what they’ve done, our generals and all of the people, what they’ve done is incredible. But remember, we took care of a lot of people, including, I guess on December 21st, we took care of Joe Biden. Cause he got his shot. He got his vaccine. He forgot. It shows you how un-painful all that vaccine shot is. So everybody go get your shot. He forgot so it wasn’t very traumatic obviously, but he got his shot and it’s good that he got his shot. Last year, I predicted to you that the extremism, corruption and incompetence of the Biden administration would be literally unprecedented in American history. Unfortunately he has proven me 100% right. Already as president, Biden has urged Congress to pass legislation shredding your Second Amendment. Your Second Amendment is in far bigger trouble than you now, and for four years I fought like hell to save your Second Amendment. And we saved it 100%.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (30:49)\n",
      "We saved it. He signed an order to conduct politically correct far left indoctrination trainings in every department of the federal government, including the US military after I had terminated these horrible things that were being preached to our military and he wants it to go forward. It’s insane within his first few hours Biden eliminated our national security travel bands on nations plagued by terrorism. His first priority was to open our borders to un-vetted travelers from Libya, Yemen, Syria, Somalia, and many other countries where strict vetting cannot occur. Countries that have tremendous problems. Countries with tremendous terrorism problems. We did it a travel ban. It was a real achievement.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (31:43)\n",
      "We told those countries, sorry, straighten out your act. We don’t want people coming in where they had an ideology or a problem. We just couldn’t have it. And it was incredible, how it worked was incredible. And he terminated it. We had to get it approved. It went all the way up to the Supreme Court of the United States. We got it approved and he terminates it. In addition, he’s already increased refugee admissions by nearly 10 times, but in effect, it’ll soon be hundreds of times as millions of people flow up through our soon to be open borders. And by the way, the border patrol and ICE, these are some of the great heroes of our country. These are incredible people. I got to know them very well.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (32:29)\n",
      "Your families still cannot go out to eat at local restaurants. But Joe Biden is bringing in thousands upon thousands of refugees from all over the world. People that nobody knows anything about, we don’t have crime records. We don’t have health records. What are they bringing in with them? When I left office, we had virtually ended the endless wars, these endless wars, they go on forever. They go on forever. I would go to Dover and I would see caskets, coffins coming in. I’d see the parents and the wives and husbands. I would see the kids. Endless wars, 19 years in Afghanistan. We have it down to almost nothing left and I hear they might want to go back in. Iraq, remember I used to say, don’t go in, but if you’re going to go in, keep the oil, well, we went in and we didn’t keep the oil. We had made historic peace deals in the middle East. Like nobody thought were even possible with not a drop of bloodshed.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (33:40)\n",
      "And by the way, not one American soldier has been killed in Afghanistan in over a year. Think of that. Not one. Those troops have largely come home. At the same time, the new administration unilaterally withdrew our crippling sanctions on Iran, foolishly giving away all of America’s leveraged before negotiations have even begun. Leave the sanctions negotiated. Does anybody understand what I’m saying here? Are there any good business people? You don’t have to be a good, are there any bad business people? They took off the sanctions. They took off the sanctions.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (34:35)\n",
      "They say, well, we’re going to not have any sanctions. Let’s negotiate a deal. I don’t know, Matt Schlep. I don’t think you would have done that, do you think so, Matt? I don’t think so. Mercedes wouldn’t have. Now you do that, you make a deal and then you do what they want it. I will tell you something and I said it, had we had a fair election, the results would have been much different and we would have had a deal with Iran within the first week. They wanted those sanctions off. He took them off for nothing, for nothing. Now you watch how tough they negotiate. In another horrendous surrender he agreed to get back into the World Health Organization.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (35:24)\n",
      "For approximately $500 million a year, which is what we were paying. When I withdrew from the WHO and you know the whole story with that, they called it badly. They really are puppets for China. They called and they wanted us to stay in. I said, how much are we paying approximately $500 million? How much is China paying a much larger in terms of population country, sir, they’re paying $39 million. I say, why are we paying 500 million and they’re paying 39? I could tell you why. Because the people that made the deal are stupid, that’s why.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (36:00)\n",
      "And I had no idea how popular it was. I didn’t even know if I would be able to politically, because people were so happy when I did get out, but I said, so if we went in, we could get it for 39 million, which is what China, not 500 million, which is what we were stupidly paying. And they said, we can make a deal, we want you to go in, we can make a deal. Okay, and I decided not to do it, but we could have had it for 39. We could have had it for the same as China. And they decide now to go back into the World Health Organization and pay 500 million, what the hell is wrong with them? No, no, this is just emblematic.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (36:46)\n",
      "It’s a tremendous amount of money, but compared to trillions, it’s not, but it’s a tremendous amount of money. Why would China pay 39 million? And we’re paying almost 500 million. Why? So we could have made the same deal that China had 39 million. And they just say, we’re going back in. We’re going back into the World Health Organization. They go back in, they pay 500. It is so sad, just like the Iran and the World Health Organization, Joe Biden put the United States back into the very unfair and very costly Paris Climate Accord without negotiating a better deal.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (37:24)\n",
      "They wanted us so badly back in. I’ll tell you they wanted us. I was getting called from all of the countries. You must come back into the Paris Accord. I said, tell me why, give me one good reason. First of all, China doesn’t kick in for 10 years, Russia goes by an old standard, which was not a clean standard and other countries, but we get hit right from the beginning would have cost us hundreds of thousands and millions of jobs. It was a disaster, but they go back in, I could have made an unbelievable deal and gone back in, but I didn’t want to do that. Surrendering millions of jobs and trillions of dollars to all of these other countries, almost all of them that were in the deal. So they have favorable treatment, we don’t have favorable treatment. And we just said, we’re going back in. To go back in, they wanted us so badly, you could’ve negotiated, if you wanted to go back in which frankly, we have the cleanest air, the cleanest water and everything else that we’ve ever had. So I don’t know why we have to.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (38:23)\n",
      "What good does it do when we’re clean, but China is not and Russia is not an India is not. So they are pouring fumes, you know the world is actually a small piece of the universe, right? They’re pouring fumes and we’re trying to protect everything and building products for three times more than is necessary. No, they could have made a great deal. If they were going to go back in, that’s fine. But they could have made a great deal and said, instead of just saying we’re back in. These people. And in one of his first official acts, which was incredible, because again, he talked about energy. He never said he was going to do this. He canceled the Keystone XL Pipeline destroying not the 8,000 or the 9,000 or the 11,000 jobs that you hear.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (39:11)\n",
      "But 42,000 great paying jobs on just about day one, right? He never talked about that during a debate because he wouldn’t have gotten away with it. Well, he would have, because they cheated so much, it probably wouldn’t have been. No, but that was not a topic of conversation. Remember fracking, you can frack. Oh, we love fracking. During the primary no fracking. As soon as he got through that, he said, no, of course everybody can frack. No fracking. You wait till you see what happens with your gasoline. Wait till you see what happens and we cannot let this stuff continue to go on. One of my proudest accomplishments as president was to make America energy independent, the United States became the number one energy superpower on Earth. Number one.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (40:09)\n",
      "Became number one. Bigger than Saudi Arabia, bigger than Russia by a lot. We left them all in the dust. They were all in the dust. But if the Democrats have their way, we are heading from energy dominance to energy disaster. That’s what’s happening. You have to see what’s going on. Everything’s being closed up. It’s a disaster. The blackouts we saw in California last summer and all the time and the windmill calamity that we’re witnessing in Texas. Great state of Texas. We love Texas, but it’s so sad when you look at it, that’ll just be the start. How bad is wind power. So I talk about it all the time at CPAC, right? We went to CPAC. Remember last I said, we’re going to watch the president, well, Alice, the wind isn’t blowing. I don’t believe we’ll have any electricity. I remember we would kid, but I wasn’t actually kidding.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (41:03)\n",
      "It’s such an expensive form of energy. It’s so bad for the environment. It kills the birds. It destroys the landscapes. And remember, these are structural columns with fans on them. They wear out, and when they wear out all over the country, you see them, nobody takes them down. They’re rotting. They’re rusting, how this is environmentally good for our country. And it costs many, many times more than natural gas, which is clean and can fuel our great factories. Wind can’t do that. And solar, I love solar, but it doesn’t have the capacity to do what we have to do to make America great again, sorry it just doesn’t have it. Under the radical Democrat policies, the price of gasoline has already surged 30% since the election. And we’ll go to $5, $6, $7 and even higher.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (42:01)\n",
      "So enjoy that when you go to the pump and they’ll say that’d be about $200 to fill up your van. Remember they used to go to the little small vans. They got away from the big ones that everybody wanted. They went to the small ones. Well, you know what? Probably a good investment. As long as these guys have their say because you know, it’s a shame what’s happening. Energy prices are going to go through the roof. And that includes your electric bills. That includes any bill having to do with energy, our biggest cost. We will now be relying on Russia and the middle East for oil. And they talk about Russia, Russia, Russia. What’s better than what this guy has done for Russia. I had oil where they were actually paying you to take it. Okay. Remember they were going to give you 37 a barrel, but you had to take it away.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (42:47)\n",
      "You had free oil almost for a period of time and one way I was proud of it, but we also had to save the energy industry and it worked out well. And I dealt with Russia and Saudi Arabia and they cut back on production and we got it back up. But now it’s going the opposite because now they are taking this incredible energy independence away from the people of our country. And you’re going to see costs go like you have never seen them go before. It’s a very sad and very stupid thing that they’re doing. The Biden policies are a massive win for other oil producing countries and a massive loss for the United States and our great citizens, Joe Biden and the Democrats are even pushing policies that would destroy women’s sports.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (43:28)\n",
      "A lot of new records are being broken in women’s sports. Hate to say that ladies, but got a lot of new records, they’re being shattered. For years, the weightlifting, every ounce is like a big deal for many years. All of a sudden somebody comes along and beats it by a hundred pounds. Boom. Now young girls and women are in sets that they are now being forced to compete against those who are biological males. It’s not good for women. It’s not good for women’s sports, which worked so long and so hard to get to where they are. The records that stood for years, even decades are now being smashed with these. Smashed. If this is not change women’s sports, as we know it will die. They’ll end, it’ll end.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (44:23)\n",
      "What coach, if I’m a coach, I want to be a great coach. What coach, as an example, wants to recruit a young woman to compete, if her record can easily be broken by somebody who was born a man. Not too many of those coaches around, right? If they are around, they won’t be around long because they’re going to have a big problem when that record is we’re oh and 16, but we’re getting better. No I think it’s crazy. I think it’s just crazy what’s happening. We must protect the integrity of women’s sports so important after. And I don’t even know, is that controversial? Somebody said, well, that’s going to be very controversial. I said, that’s okay. You haven’t heard anything yet.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (45:31)\n",
      "As you can see, the early weeks of the Biden administration have nothing less than, they’ve been a catastrophe for American workers and for American families, the task of our mission. And for us, it’s our movement. As I said, a movement like has never been seen, I think we could probably say, never been seen anywhere in the world. And nobody’s ever seen a movement like this. I’d grow up and I’d watch somebody who came in second in New Hampshire or first in Iowa and that was the end. And they became famous for the rest of their lives. We won the election twice. I mean, think about it, twice. The task for our movement and our party is to stand up to this destructive agenda with confidence and with result, the future of the Republican party is as a party that defends the social economic and cultural interests and values of working American families of every race, color, and creed. That’s why the party is growing so rapidly and is becoming a different party. And it’s becoming a party of love. You have to see outside the streets. I mean, there’s such love. The flags. Amazing. That’s right now, it’s a party that’s incredible. The people, the spirit, and there are, as you probably heard a little while ago, I mean, there’s more spirit now than there’s ever been, including even before the election, more spirit now than we’ve ever seen, because people are seeing how bad it can be. And again, I want to thank Rush and Catherine, because what he did to get the word out has been incredible. Some people are irreplaceable as Sean Hannity would say and he said Rush is irreplaceable, but his spirit lives on. And that’s something that we need and we love. Republicans believe that the needs of every citizen must come first. In fact, America must come first. We don’t put it first.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (48:03)\n",
      "America must come first. We don’t put it first. They don’t put it first. Over the past four years my administration delivered for Americans of all backgrounds like never before, like never before. We built the strongest economy in the history of the world, raised wages and achieved the lowest African-American, Hispanic-American, Asian-American unemployment rates ever, ever, ever recorded. It was so great for everybody of all backgrounds that even after the China virus, we are leading the world. Nobody’s even close. We’re leading it in the comeback. Our economic comeback has been incredible. That’s because the financial and economic foundation we built was so strong, that unlike other countries who are having a hard time, we didn’t break. We came roaring back, and now our stock market and your 401(k)s are again at record levels, higher than ever before, actually.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (49:05)\n",
      "Many people have asked, “What is Trumpism?” A new term being used more and more. I’m hearing that term more and more. I didn’t come up with it. But what it means is great deals, great trade deals. Great ones, not deals where we give away everything, our jobs, our money, like the USMCA replacement of the horrible NAFTA. NAFTA was one of the worst deals ever made, probably the worst trade deal ever made, and we ended it. A lot of people forget, we ended it.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (49:33)\n",
      "Now we have the USMCA-Mexico-Canada. It’s incredible what it’s done for our farmers, who are doing fantastically. Did you see grain prices and grain sales are at an all-time high? Wheat, all-time high. So many elements of farms and farmers, and they love me. Remember, it’s going to be very close in Iowa. Well, it wasn’t close. We won in a landslide, Iowa, because our farmers know, and they put up with it, and we did a lot of work with the tariffs and all these things that we had to do to get it. Now the farmers are doing great, but they’re setting records.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (50:08)\n",
      "It means low taxes and eliminating job-killing regulations, Trumpism. It means strong borders, but people coming into our country based on a system of merit. They come in and they can help us, as opposed to coming here and not being good for us, including criminals, of which there are many. It means no riots in the streets. It means law enforcement. It means very strong protection for the Second Amendment and the right to keep and bear arms. It means support for the forgotten men and women who have been taken advantage of for so many years. They were doing great. They were doing great before that horrible thing from China came in and hit us, and now they’re starting to do really well again.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (51:06)\n",
      "If you think about it, we built the economy twice. We built it then, and then like every other country in the world, it went down, and then we built it again. Now it’s higher in many ways, certainly in the stock market, it’s higher in many ways than it was before. That’s because of the foundation, and no country comes even close to competing with our comeback. It means a strong military and taking care of our vets, but a strong military, which we have totally rebuilt. We have rebuilt it. Our military has never been stronger than it is today. It was tired. It was depleted. It was obsolete. Now we have the best brand-new equipment ever made, and it was all produced right here in the USA. Isn’t that nice? We take care of our vets. We had a poll recently just before leaving office. The vets had a 91% approval rating for the way we took care of them. That’s the highest number in the history of the polls, the vet polls.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (52:16)\n",
      "On top of all of that, we have even created the Space Force, the first new branch of the United States military in nearly 75 years. The mission of the Democrat party is to promote socialism. They want to promote socialism, ultimately leading, unfortunately, to communism, and that will happen. If you look at Venezuela, you look at some of these countries, that’s why some of our biggest supporters are from South America, Latin America, because they’ve seen what goes on with all of this cancel culture, and you can’t speak, and let’s cut them off and let’s not give them words. The mission of our movement and of the Republican party must be to create a future of good jobs, strong families, safe communities, a vibrant culture, and a great nation for all Americans, and that’s what we’re creating.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (53:17)\n",
      "Their party is based upon unvarnished disdain for America, its past and its people. You see that happening. It’s horrible the way they treat the legacy of our country, the culture of our country. Our party is based on love for America and the belief that this is an exceptional nation, blessed by God. We take great pride in our country. We teach the truth about history. We celebrate our rich heritage and national traditions. We honor George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson, and all national heroes, and of course, we respect our great American flag.\n",

      "I started that hearing… Really, we’re getting word of that, hearing that during some of the rallies, especially the latter rallies, where we set records. We had 56 unbelievable packed rallies, and nobody’s ever had anything like we had. We started hearing, “We love you.” I asked somebody, because we really liked Ronald Reagan. He was a great President. We had others, but I said, “Did anybody ever say that to Ronald Reagan or to any of our great…” and to the best of all of these political professionals’ knowledge and pollsters’, nobody’s ever heard that chant before, Matt, so it’s an honor. Believe me, it’s an honor. It’s a great honor. It’s a great honor. When you think about, we love you, you say that about, I hate to say it, am I a politician? I don’t know. Maybe I’m a politician. I hate to admit it, but that’s really… It’s an honor that you would say it.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (55:48)\n",
      "We believe in patriotic education and strongly oppose the radical indoctrination of America’s youth. It’s horrible. We are committed to defending innocent life and to upholding the Judeo-Christian values of our founders and of our founding. We embrace free thought. We stand up to political correctives, and we reject left-wing lunacy, and in particular, we reject cancel culture.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (56:40)\n",
      "We know that the rule of law is the ultimate safeguard. We affirm that the Constitution means exactly what it says, as written, as written. They want to change it. They want to change it. They want to get rid of it, frankly. We believe in law and order. We believe that the men and women of law enforcement are heroes who truly deserve our absolute support. We don’t defund the police. We are not defunding the police. We believe in standing up to China, shutting down, outsourcing, bringing back our factories and supply chains and ensuring that America, not China, dominates the future of the world. That’s what’s going to happen. By the way, we took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China during my administration, hundreds. They never gave us 25 cents. It was a one-way street. We took in hundreds of billions. During negotiations, they would say, “Look, the one thing, we don’t want any more of these tariffs, these tariffs.” Those tariffs, we took in so much money, and what happened is, they became competitive. What happened with people, they wouldn’t go to China. They’d build a lot of it back in our country. They would make it here instead. In addition to that, we were taking in billions and billions and billions of dollars from China. But in all fairness to China, we made a trade deal with them. This was prior to COVID. Once COVID happened, I no longer cared so much about the trade deal, because what happened with that was just disgraceful.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (58:21)\n",
      "But that’s one of the things, that’s one of the reasons that right now our farmers are doing so good. I used to tell China, “Look, look, go and get a lot of wheat. Get a lot of different things, all of the things we just talked about, you better go out and do it, because this country has not been treated fairly by you for many, many years, many, many years.” We used to lose $504 billion trade deficit with China, 504, not million. $504 million is a lot, right? You know that through the World Health Organization. Now take 504 million and make it $504 billion, we had deficits with China. It was absolutely insane that this could keep going. It’s amazing that you still have a country left.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (59:06)\n",
      "The people that did this to our country, they should be ashamed of themselves. They should be ashamed of themselves. Companies that leave America to create jobs in China and other countries that have ripped us off for years should not be rewarded. They should be tariffed, fined and punished. They should not be rewarded. That’s what the Biden administration is doing. But of course, as you know, they have a very close, personal relationship with China, so I don’t expect much to happen. It’s a shame, because it really is a threat. It’s a tremendous economic threat. Thank God we’ve rebuilt our military, but it’s a tremendous economic threat. Never forget it. These are the convictions that define our movement today and must define the Republican party in the years ahead. Very simple, it’s really quite simple, isn’t it?\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:00:07)\n",
      "Another one of the most urgent issues facing the Republican party is that of ensuring fair, honest and secure elections. Such a disgrace, such a disgrace, such a disgrace. We must pass comprehensive election reforms, and we must do it now. The Democrats used the China virus as an excuse to change all of the election rules without the approval of their state legislatures, making it therefore illegal and had a massive impact on the election. Again, you have to go to the legislatures to get these approvals. This alone would have easily changed the outcome of the election at levels that you wouldn’t have even believed. Even with COVID, even with all of the things, the numbers are staggering. We can never let this or other abuses of the 2020 election be repeated or happen again, can never let that happen again. You see what’s going on. We’ve been set back so greatly with other countries and with the world. We need election integrity and election reform immediately. Republicans should be the party of honest elections that can give everyone confidence in the future of our country. Without honest elections, who has confidence? Who has confidence? This issue is being studied and examined. But the reality is you cannot have a situation where ballots are indiscriminately pouring in from all over the country, tens of millions of ballots. Where are they coming from? They’re coming all over the place, where illegal aliens and dead people are voting, and many other horrible things are happening that are too voluminous to even mention, but people know.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:02:20)\n",
      "I mean, it’s being studied, and the level of dishonesty is not to be believed. We have a very sick and corrupt electoral process that must be fixed immediately. This election was rigged, and the Supreme Court and other courts didn’t want to do anything about it.\n",
      "Audience: (01:02:39)\n",
      "You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won. You won.\n",

      "Donald Trump: (01:03:09)\n",
      "If you just take that one element where they didn’t go through legislatures, it’s illegal. You can’t do it. It’s in the Constitution. They didn’t have the courage, the Supreme Court. They didn’t have the courage to act, but instead, used process and lack of standing. I was told the President of the United States has no standing. It’s my election. It’s your election. We have no standing. If you’re think of it, we had almost 20 states go into the Supreme Court so that we didn’t have a standing problem. They rejected it. They rejected it. They should be ashamed of themselves for what they’ve done to our country. They didn’t have the guts or the courage to make the right decision. They didn’t want to talk about it. You had the case led by the great State of Texas. 18 states went in, “You don’t have standing. Oh, let’s not talk about it.” They didn’t have the guts to do what should be done, and that’s on top of all of the other forms of cheating. But this is the most basic of all, they would have local courts and local politicians change the rules, in some cases, a day or two before the election. This should never be allowed to happen to another presidential candidate or presidential race, should never be allowed to happen.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:04:43)\n",
      "Today I want to outline the steps that we must take to have an election system in this country that is honest, fair and accurate. We need one election day, not 45, 30, one day like it’s been. The Republicans don’t get this and the other things I’m going to say, that you should, like the Supreme Court, be ashamed of yourselves. One day, one day, and the only people that should be allowed to vote by mail are people that can be proven to be either very sick, or out of the country, or military where they can’t do it. One day. They have millions and millions of ballots sitting around all over the place for long periods of time. Gee, I wonder what happens with those ballots? I wonder what happens? It’s common sense. It’s a disgrace. It’s an absolute disgrace. There should be a legitimate reason for someone to vote absentee, has to have a reason. We should eliminate the insanity of mass and very corrupt mail-in voting.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:06:03)\n",
      "We must have voter ID, voter ID. To get into the Democrat National Convention, when they had the convention, you needed voter ID. You needed an ID card. You couldn’t get in unless you had an ID. So many people told me you can’t get in that place. You need ID. Nobody had ID. You need voter ID. They know that. There’s a con job. They’re conning everybody. They know that. They know the wall was good. They knew the wall would work, but they didn’t want to have it, because we wanted it. I made one big mistake in the wall. I should have said, “We will not have a wall.” Then they would have said, “Let’s build a wall.” I made a big mistake. I made a big mistake. I’m sorry. It took us a year and a half extra. Because of that mistake, we will not have a wall. “We need a wall immediately,” said Chuck Schumer.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:07:13)\n",
      "We need universal signature matching. They want to pass a bill where you don’t have to match signatures, where signatures don’t mean anything. Now they know it, just like with the wall, just like with voter ID, when you need to go into anything that’s Democrat run, you need it. But for voting, which is our most sacred institution, you don’t. They don’t want to let you have it. There should be a 100% requirement to verify the citizenship of every person who votes, and there must be a chain of custody protections for every ballot, every ballot. You saw what happened in Detroit and Philadelphia and many other places, swing states mostly, all over, but swing states mostly. You saw what happened? You saw what was going on.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:08:13)\n",
      "You saw that more people… You take a look at the votes. When you have more votes than you have people, that’s a problem, right? Is that a problem? We have a little problem adjusting in Detroit. We seem to have more votes than we have people, a lot more votes, an election-changing number. We’re not talking about a number where you catch… No, these are election-changing numbers. In Pennsylvania, they had hundreds of thousands of more votes than they had people voting. What’s that all about? What’s that all about? Cheating, they say. Yeah, I’d say so.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:08:50)\n",
      "In the history of our country, and it has taken place for years in Pennsylvania, in Detroit and various other places, but there’s tremendous, never like this, because they used COVID as a way of cheating. That’s what happened, and everybody knows it. Hundreds of thousands and millions of ballots, they used it as a way of getting what they’ve wanted for many years, and the Republicans have to do something about it. They’d better do something about it. Our election process is worse than that, in many cases, of a third-world country. You know that. You saw what was going on.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:09:26)\n",
      "Even if you consider nothing else, it is undeniable that election rules were illegally changed at the last minute in almost every swing state, with the procedures rewritten by local politicians… you’re not allowed to do that… and local judges. They want more time. They want this. They want that. All done by local politicians or local judges, as opposed to state legislatures as required by the Constitution of the United States. These are numbers that are massive. These aren’t little numbers. These are numbers that in each state is a transformative number. It changes the outcome of the election, and it’s not close. Regardless of your political views, this should concern you as a constitutional matter. The Supreme court, again, didn’t have the guts or the courage to do anything about it, and neither did other judges.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:10:24)\n",
      "Democrats even admitted in Time Magazine, which is I would say on the liberal side, that they couldn’t… They couldn’t hold it in. They had to brag about it, because what they did, they had a brag about it. They couldn’t do it. You got to read this story. It’s a disaster. It’s a disaster for our country that we can allow something so corrupt to happen. Read that article. I really encourage you. You read that article.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:10:52)\n",
      "Yet all of the election integrity measures in the world will mean nothing if we don’t have free speech. That’s where we’re at now. If Republicans can be censored for speaking the truth and calling out corruption, we will not have democracy, and we will have only left-wing tyranny. We can do this. We can do this. We’re smarter than they are. We’re tougher than they are. For some reason, we just don’t. We don’t get it done. We let them attack our businesses, and we don’t attack their businesses. I believe your numbers are bigger than their numbers, but you’re nicer than they are. You’re not as vicious as they are.\n",

      "In the past, we would debate. I would have it. I’d debate. You’ve seen me for many years. They’d throw something. I debate. They debate. Who knows who wins. People go. They vote. They see what happens, but they would have an idea. They would disagree. The public would hear it. The debate and discourse would take place, and then somebody would make a decision. You would win. You would lose. The public would make up its mind. But now there is no debate, because they refuse to allow our side to even speak or be heard.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:12:03)\n",
      "There is no debate because they refuse to allow our side to even speak or be heard. They don’t want debate, because we have easy victories in a debate, very easy victories. It’s is called common sense. It’s called other things, but it’s called common sense. So they don’t want a debate. The time has come to break up big tech monopolies and restore fair competition. Republicans, conservatives must open up our platforms and repeal section 230 liability protections. And if the federal government refuses to act, then every state in the union where we have the votes, which is a lot of them, big tech giants, like Twitter, Google, and Facebook should be punished with major sanctions whenever they silence conservative voices. And governor Ron DeSantis of Florida and in Texas and in other States are doing this. If they do what they’re doing, Florida, and that legislation will pass. And Texas and others will have tremendous power to do what’s right and what’s fair.\n",

      "We have no time to waste, Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats in Congress are racing to pass a flagrantly unconstitutional attack on the first amendment and the integrity of our elections known as HR 1. Do you know what HR 1 is? It’s a disaster. Their bill would drastically restrict political speech, empower power the federal government to shut down decent. And turn the Federal Election Commission into a partisan political weapon. In addition, it virtually eliminates voter ID requirements nationwide, effectively ends all registration deadlines. Can you believe this? Requires States to give ballots to felons, automatically registers every welfare recipient to vote, and puts unaccountable unelected bureaucrats in charge of drawing congressional districts. That’s going to be a lot of fun. This monster must be stopped. It cannot be allowed to pass. Now more than ever is the time for tough strong and energetic Republican leaders who have spines of steel. We need strong leadership. We cannot have leaders who show more passion for condemning their fellow Americans than they have ever shown for standing up to Democrats, the media, and the radicals who want to turn America into a socialist country. Instead of attacking me and more importantly the voters of our movement, top establishment Republicans in Washington should be spending their energy in opposing Biden, Pelosi, Schumer, and the Democrats. I’ve said to some of them, I said, “You know, during the Obama years, and now during Biden, if you spent the same energy on attacking them, you’d actually be successful as you do on attacking me, in many cases.” The Democrats don’t have grandstanders like Mitt Romney, little Ben Sasse, Richard Burr, Bill Cassidy, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Pat Toomey, and in the house, Tom Rice, South Carolina, Adam Kinzinger, Dan Newhouse, Anthony Gonzalez. That’s another beauty. Fred Upton, Jaime Herrera Beutler, Peter Meyer, John Katko, David Valadao. And of course the warmonger, a person that loves seeing our troops fighting, Liz Cheney. How about that? The good news is in her state, she’s been censured, and in her state, her poll numbers have dropped faster than any human being I’ve ever seen. So hopefully they’ll get rid of her with the next election. Get rid of them all. Democrats are vicious. Remember this, it’s true. Democrats are vicious.\n",

      "He said evil, well, there is evil there, but they’re vicious, they’re smart, and they do one thing. You got to hand it to them. They always stick together. You don’t have Mitt Romney’s in the group. They always stick together. Fortunately, for the Republican party, the Democrats have horrible policies like open borders, sanctuary cities, defunding the police, and the ridiculous, totally ridiculous green new deal. So, they stick together, they’re smart. They’re vicious, they got everything going, but their policies are no good. So hence, we have, congratulations, the Republican party. After this, they may not stick with those policies. We have to be careful. No, their policies are horrible. Think of it, defund the police. How did that work out? But if Republicans do not stick together, the rhinos that we’re surrounded with will destroy the Republican party and the American worker, and will destroy our country itself, the rhinos, Republican in name only, but the Republican party is united. The only division is between a handful of Washington DC establishment political hacks, and everybody else all over the country.\n",

In fact, I hated to follow you. I want to follow other people. I could name them too. I like to follow other people. I heard you were great. Thank you Jim, very much. Jim Jordan. A great, great athlete. People don’t know he was a great wrestler, tremendous numbers of victories. He was a champion. He was college champion for a long period of time. He’s a winner and a leader and he doesn’t play games. He likes to win. He likes to win. And we have a lot of people in our party that like to win Jim, right? But I heard you were great, thank you very much. But we want Republican leaders who are loyal to the voters and who will work proudly for the vision that I’ve laid out today. And what is it?

Who would’ve thought that was going to happen? Who would have thought that’s going to happen, Jim? In last year’s congressional primaries, 120, listen to this, it’s crazy. 120 of 122 candidates I endorsed won, 120. That’s almost as good as Jim’s wrestling record. And the two that lost were beaten by people claiming to be more Trump than their opponent. So I like those two people very much also.

He asked for my endorsement, brought him from one point down to 20 points up, and he won his race in the great state, and actually the great Commonwealth of Kentucky. And he won it very easily. And I said, “I wonder if I’m doing the right thing here.” But you know what? I did what I did. But he went from one point down to 20 points up very quickly, immediately actually. And he won his race. And if you compare that to his other elections, I’m sure you’ll see something interesting. But you know what? We got a Republican elected. And now we have to use Republicans to take care of the election frauds and all of the other things that are happening that shouldn’t be allowed to happen in our country. It’s very simple. Because of my efforts campaigning, we had huge gains in the House, and I helped keep many senators in their seats, and they will admit it, so that it’s now 50/50, instead of Republicans being down anywhere from eight to 10 seats.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:22:25)\n",
      "And they’ll admit it, we’d be down eight to 10 seats if I didn’t campaign. We held rallies for some of the senators that were down. And nobody talks about that. Nobody wants to talk, the press doesn’t talk about it. With me at the top of the ticket, not a single Republican member of Congress lost their race for the first time in decades. We won 26 of 26 toss up races. Toss up. Think of that, 26 of 20, and those are toss up. Those are races that could go any way. We were expected to lose 25 seats, and instead we won 15 seats, and almost, oh, why couldn’t we have done a couple of more, almost cost crazy Nancy her job. We’ll do that the next time around. I received almost, listen to this number, because you know, the fake news doesn’t ever talk about these numbers. I just heard this one for the first time. I received almost 1.5 million more votes than all of the Republican House candidates combined.\n",

We, we got more votes than any incumbent, any incumbent president in the history of our country, almost 75 million votes. And that doesn’t include the votes and ballots they threw out. If you include them, you’ll see numbers that are much different. We did even better in the second election than we did in the first, you know I won the first? And we won the second, we did much better. Sort of strange, right? How did you do? Well, we did much better the second time. Oh, you did? Really? What a disgrace, what a disgrace to our country. I got over 11 million, very close to 12 million more votes than we got in 2016. And I was told by John McLaughlin that if you, the great pollster, that if you get to, we had 63 in 2016, 63 million.\n",

      "Sir, if you get to 66 million, you have it made. We got to almost 75 million. Then what the hell happened? What happened? What happened when they closed all of the counting booths? What happened at 3:00 in the morning? What happened at 3:02 in the morning? What happened? No president has ever lost an election after carrying Florida, Ohio, and Iowa. And I won them all. And I won them by a lot. By a lot. I won 94% of the primary vote, no incumbent president who received more than 75% of the primary vote has ever lost an election. I had a record number, and no president has ever, ever, and we’re talking about a much lower number than we got, has ever lost an election. Thanks to my coattails, thank you. We have to have a sense of humor. Thanks to my coattails, democrats failed to flip a single state legislature. Think of it, or a legislative chamber, because Republicans came out to vote for me. Now they say it differently. The press, the fake news spins it differently.\n",

      "They say, “Despite how well they did, Trump didn’t win.” That’s such a lie. And many legislators, many legislators told me, they said, they were going to lose their race. It wasn’t going to happen. And then what happened is one in particular told me from a great swing state, said, “You know, I thought I was going to lose my position, lose my race. And I went out with my wife the night before the election. And I saw all these Trump signs and the American flags and the spirits on the streets.” I said, “You know, darling, I think we’re going to win.” He said, “But you were far, far, far more popular than me.” They do lots of polls. You were way, way ahead of me, sir. And the next day I was right. He said, he won the election by a lot, and you lost the election. And sir, it’s not possible that you lost, because you got a lower number than I did. And you were so far ahead of me. You’re the person that brought everybody out to vote.\n",

And in November, 18 of 19 bellwether counties, you heard about the bellwether counties? 18 of 19 bellwether counties that have correctly predicted every presidential election election for decades. Many decades, voted for Trump, not for Biden. And it was a shocker to those people that go for the stats. It was a shocker. They voted for Trump, 18 of 19 voted for Trump. There’s never been anything like that. And yet did Biden win? No. If you want to help us take back the future of our country, go to DonaldJTrump.com. I don’t do this.

We need your help to win, and to fight big tech and the radical left and the DC establishment. We need to save your second amendment, which is under siege. We need to help protect funding for our military and for our great vets. And that’s what we’re doing. As we discussed earlier, we’re in a struggle for the survival of America as we know it. This is a struggle. This is a terrible, terrible, painful struggle. The path ahead will not be easy, but we will win. We are going to win. Ultimately we always win.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:29:11)\n",
      "And when we do, history will show that this was the moment when we could have given up, when we could have despaired. But instead, we chose to keep on pushing forward. The greater the challenge and tougher the task, the more determined we must be to pull through to triumph. We have to have triumph. We have to have victory. With the talent and dedication of everyone here today, and you have tremendous, not only dedication, tremendous talent in this room. I know many of you. That is exactly what we will do. We will go on to victory. We will summon the spirit of generations of American Patriots before us, like those heroes who crossed the Delaware, conquered the Rockies, stormed the beaches, won the battles, and tamed the unknown frontiers. We will persist, and we will prevail. We’re tougher than they are. We’re stronger than they are. Together, in the coming years, we will carry forward the torch of American Liberty. We will lead the conservative movement and the Republican party back to a totally conclusive victory.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:30:26)\n",
      "And we’ve had tremendous victories. Don’t ever forget it. With your help, we will take back the House. We will win the Senate. And then, a Republican president will make a triumphant return to the White House. And I wonder who that will be? I wonder who that will be? Who, who, who will that be? I wonder. Standing before you today, I am supremely confident that for our movement, for our party, and for our country, our brightest days are just ahead. And that together we will make America prouder, freer, stronger and greater than it ever has been before. Thank you CPAC, God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you all. Thank you.\n",

      "As one nation, America mourns the loss of our brave and brilliant American service members in a savage and barbaric terrorist attack in Afghanistan. These noble American warriors laid down their lives in the line of duty. They sacrifice themselves so the country that they loved, racing against time to rescue their fellow citizens from harm’s way. They died as American heroes and our nation will honor their memory forever. I want to express my deepest condolences to the families of those we have lost. Today all Americans grieve alongside you. Together we also pray that God will heal the other courageous American service members who were wounded in this heinous attack. In addition, our hearts are with the families of all the innocent civilians who died, and with the many men, women, and children who were terribly injured in this act of evil.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:00)\n",
      "This tragedy should never have taken place, it should never have happened, and it would not have happened if I were your president. Over the past few weeks I know that many Americans have felt profound sorrow and even pain watching the events taking place in Afghanistan, and perhaps none more so than the veterans of that 20 year war. Many of them answered the call proudly and without hesitation after the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001. Every American who served in Afghanistan has made tremendous sacrifices for our country. On behalf of your fellow citizens, I want you to know that those sacrifices were not made in vain. We know what you did, we know how brave you were, and we thank you, we salute you, and we honor you for all time. I hope that every American will join me in continuing to pray for the safe return of all US citizens and soldiers from Afghanistan in the coming days. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America.\n",

      "… In the way. There’s no topic on which they, the elites, the big firms, the progressives, the office holders and the bureaucrats, there is no other topic that they are seeing as a bigger obstacle to achieve their ambitions than the first amendment. The first amendment, the bulwark of our liberties, is what enables us as citizens to resist them at every turn. The first amendment truly stands between them and us. When they try to tell us what to read, the first amendment gets in their way. When they try to tell us what to think, the first amendment gets in their way.\n",
      "Brooke Rollins: (00:42)\n",
      "When they try to tell us what to believe, the first amendment gets in their way. And when they try to tell us with whom to worship, with whom to associate, with whom to congregate and with whom to be friends, the first amendment gets in their way. It’s no surprise then that they want the first amendment gone. They don’t advocate for abolition of course, they know better than that. But they do advocate for curtailing it into meaninglessness. Nowhere is that more evident than in the suppression of first amendment rights online. In just a minute, the President will talk about this and what he intends to do about it.\n",
      "Brooke Rollins: (01:28)\n",
      "It’s enough for me to say this. What was just a decade back a mere fiction of paranoid dystopia, a handful of technology companies effectively seizing control of the American public square, is now our own present reality. Against them, this president fights for you as he always has and as he always will. Ultimately, the issue at hand is the same issue that has gripped the nation since the day, almost exactly six years ago, when Donald Trump made his famous escalator ride into history, becoming Candidate Trump, and then Nominee Trump, and then President Trump.\n",
      "Brooke Rollins: (02:12)\n",
      "The issue is simply this. It was then, it is today. Who rules in America? Is it a handful of unaccountable and unelected elites who concoct and enforce standards arbitrarily? If so, we should pack up the American experiment, call the American dream done, issue aristocratic titles and be done with the charade. Or are the rulers of this country still the people, the democratic citizenry who do honest work every single day and ask only for a fair and equitable treatment in return? We need that answer. This country just finished an Independence Day celebration, where we talked about and celebrated everything we have been and everything we have meant as a country. For the sake of future independence days, for the sake of future American generations, we must fight for the people’s rule. That’s what Donald Trump is here to do and that’s what he’s always done. Please help me welcome President Donald J. Trump.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (03:25)\n",
      "Thank you very much, Brooke, I appreciate that. Thank you everybody. I just want to say that I stand before you this morning to announce a very important and very beautiful, I think, development for our freedom and our freedom of speech, and that goes to all Americans. Today in conjunction with the America first policy Institute, I’m filing as the lead class representative, a major class action lawsuit against the big tech giants, including Facebook, Google and Twitter, as well as their CEOs, Mark Zuckerberg, Sundar Pichai and Jack Dorsey, three real nice guys. We’re asking the US District Court for the Southern District of Florida to order an immediate halt to social media companies’ illegal, shameful censorship of the American people, and that’s exactly what they are doing. We’re demanding an end to the shadow banning, a stop to the silencing and a stop to the blacklisting, banishing and canceling that you know so well. Our case will prove this censorship is unlawful, it’s unconstitutional and it’s completely un-American.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (04:57)\n",
      "We all know that very, very well. Our filing also seeks injunctive relief to allow prompt restitution and really restoration and you can name about 20 other things and it has to be prompt because it’s destroying our country. Of my accounts, in addition, we are asking the court to impose punitive damages on these social media giants. We’re going to hold big tech very accountable. This is the first of numerous other lawsuits, I assume that would follow. But this is the lead and I think it’s going to be a very, very important game changer for our country. It will be a pivotal battle in the defense of the first amendment. And in the end, I am confident that we will achieve a historic victory for American freedom and at the same time freedom of speech. So I want to thank all of the exceptional legal team behind this effort.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (06:09)\n",
      "In particular [inaudible 00:06:10] we have a lot of the tobacco lawyers. I said, “Who are the best lawyers?” Well, the tobacco lawyers seem to do a very good job. So I figured let’s see if they want to do it, and they really wanted to do it. We have great, great talent. I also want to thank Brooke Rollins, just an outstanding person and friend. She’s carrying it out to a level that nobody saw and she’s done it very quickly together with Linda McMahon, a tremendously successful woman who did an incredible job in the administration, one of the best, and everyone at the America first policy Institute for their support of this vital initiative. From the very beginning of our nation, freedom of speech has always been understood as a bedrock of our liberty and our strength. In America, we recognize that the freedom to speak our minds and express the truth, that is our heart, that’s really a big chunk of our heart. It is our heart. It is not granted to us by government, it’s given to us by God and no one should have the power to take that right away. The founding fathers inscribed this right in the very first amendment to our constitution because they knew that free speech is essential to the prevention, and look, to the prevention of horror and to the preservation of our republic. But remember the words, the prevention of horror, because we’re very close to seeing that now in our country. We’ve never been in a position like this, and it’s all happened very quickly. In the words of the father of our country, although some would like to take that title away from him, George Washington, he will not be canceled. If freedom of speech may be taken away, then dumb and silent, we may be led like sheep to the slaughter, pretty well-known phrase and so true. Unfortunately today, this fundamental American right on liberty is under incredible threat and attack by a lot of different sides.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (08:48)\n",
      "But we are the majority side by a lot. I believe we are the majority side by far more than anybody would understand. You just have to take a look at what happened in recent elections and add up the right numbers. You will see a majority like you wouldn’t believe because nobody can believe what some of the things that are being said are. Nobody believes that. Social media has given extraordinary power to a group of big tech giants that are working with government, the mainstream media and a large segment of a political party to silence and suppress the views of the American people and they’ve been very, very successful at that. Not in all cases, but in many cases, totally successful. While the social media companies are officially private entities, in recent years they have ceased to be private with the enactment and their historical use of section 230, which profoundly protects them from liability.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (09:54)\n",
      "Once they got section 230, they’re not private companies anymore in a lot of views. No other companies in our country, and even in our country’s history, have had protection like this. It’s, in effect, a massive government subsidy. These companies have been co-opted, coerced and weaponized by government and by government actors to become the enforces of illegal, unconstitutional censorship. And that’s what it is at the highest level, censorship. And so many other things that perhaps are even worse. And you’ll be seeing that in this lawsuit, as it wells its way through the courts, we have all seen Democrats in Congress hall the CEOs of these companies before their committees and attempt to threaten them, bully them and intimidate them like nobody has been intimidated. But they made a deal. They all get along very nicely now, thank you very much. Congress has repeatedly told big tech that if they do not silence Democrats’ political opponents, ban prominent conservative voices, I wonder who that would be, and restrict what the left ominously labels as disinformation, and they are the greatest disinformation group of people ever, ever in the world. As an example, just recently, now they’re saying, “We never said defund the police. We want to fund the police.” They looked at poll numbers at 85% against them. “No, no, no. We want to take care of the police state.” No, they don’t. They want to fund the police. And they’ll say it thousands and thousands and thousands of times. And by the end of 12 months, you’ll all be saying, “Oh, they love the police.” They don’t love the police. They actually hate the police for whatever reason, and it’s just a terrible thing. And so many other-\n",
      "Donald Trump: (12:03)\n",
      "… for whatever reason, and it’s just a terrible thing. And so many other things. They’re changing their views on so many other things and they just say the opposite. They don’t even go to anything. They just all in unison, a lot of the people sitting right before me understand exactly what I’m saying. They say it right before you. That we want to do this. We want to do that. It’s the exact opposite of what they’ve been saying. Or, probably the most famous of all, Russia, Russia, Russia. Trump loves Russia. He loves Russia. He loves Putin. He loves Russia. That went on for two years and some people believed it, but we are going to look so closely and we’re going to make sure that the liability protections that they have under section 230 is at a very minimum changed. And maybe at a maximum taken away.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (12:54)\n",
      "The Supreme Court has made it exceedingly clear that Congress is not allowed to coerce private entities into doing what Congress does. They’re not allowed to do it. The lawful authority is just not there. They can’t do it. They bully and they coerce. Yet, that’s exactly what’s taking place every single day. It’s a flagrant violation of The Constitution going on before our very eyes. I hate to say this, but they do it with the Supreme Court, too. They play the refs. They play the refs. They talk about all sorts of things they’re going to do to Supreme Court justices. We’re going to impeach him. We’re going to impeach him. We’re going to impeach him. And then, lo and behold, all of a sudden different decisions come out. Or, we’re going to enlarge that court to a level that nobody can believe. We are going to take that court and we’re going to enlarge. We’re going to have 16. We’re going to have 20. I saw one the other day, we’re going to have 24 justices.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (14:07)\n",
      "I guess things happen because all of a sudden decisions come out. They play the ref. They play the ref better than Bobby Knight has ever played the ref. We can’t let that happen and hopefully our Supreme Court justices and other judges and justices, they stand up for our values and they don’t let that happen. In addition, in recent years, we have also seen increasing coordination between big tech, giants and government agencies, such as the Centers for Disease Control. Where so much was wrong. So many things could have been different, but big tech happened to choose the wrong side and they banned the right side. For example, YouTube’s policy, explicitly forbids contradicting ” health authorities.”\n",
      "Donald Trump: (15:03)\n",
      "You know the health authorities. Fortunately, I overrode the health authorities quite a bit. That was a lot of good decisions made. If I didn’t, we would have been in much bigger trouble. Like you see other countries right now are still in very, very big trouble. Through such coordination, the federal government has essentially deputized social media platforms to become the defacto censorship arm of the US government, which is exactly what’s happened. This was especially clear during the pandemic when social media giants began censoring information, according to guidance by the CDC, which as we now know, was very often incorrect or wrong.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (15:52)\n",
      "This censorship is yet another blatant violation of the constitution. There are so many violations of our constitution and you’ll see that in the suit, which will also be added to, because other things are happening on a daily basis, that will be added as we go along. Consider just some of the information that has been censored in America over the past year. Until recently, Facebook had a policy to eliminate all posts sharing evidence that the horrible virus emerged from China. They said it didn’t emerge from the Chinese lab. Wuhan. Remember? I said, Wuhan and it was like a bomb went up.Wuhan. Came from the Wuhan lab. Of course there were body bags all outside the lab. Nobody ever mentions that. I wonder why?\n",
      "Donald Trump: (16:45)\n",
      "They said it came a thousand miles away from a bat or it came from another country. They tried to blame Italy. They tried to blame us. But they gave that one up. That was also misinformation. But then it was finally revealed that this was most likely the truth. That it came from the lab. And it was a small little story. But when I said it it was like a weapon went off. A major weapon. I won’t use the word weapon, because I never used the word nuclear, but we have to be careful with our leadership because if we don’t have the proper leadership, we’re in a very perilous state. So we don’t use the word nuclear. I never use it. Okay? Never use it. I never said it. That’s called disinformation.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (17:32)\n",
      "Google and YouTube have deleted countless videos that dared to question the judgment of the World Health Organization, which has been wrong so often. It’s been a really pipe organ for China, as most of you know. Calling those videos misinformation, including videos that consist of clear scientific fact. Doctors and medical groups have been barred from these platforms for posting about therapeutics, such as hydroxychloroquine. Huh. That’s a familiar name. Which now, most recent studies say, is effective in combating the virus. Three cents a pill. The drug companies don’t like three cents a pill. Three cents a pill is what it costs. But recent studies have come out very strongly in favor.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (18:28)\n",
      "Twitter has censored users simply for using the term illegal alien, which it has labeled as hateful content. And just taking you off for whatever reason. You have to see the sentence they took me off for. It’s the most loving sentence. It’s really amazing. They could have done better, because I’ve had a lot of worse. I couldn’t believe that was the reason. Take a look at it. You know exactly the sentence I’m talking of. It’s become very famous. People are saying, “Really?” Even the other side said, “Really?”\n",
      "Donald Trump: (19:04)\n",
      "And of course there is no better evidence that big tech is out of control than the fact that they banned the sitting president of the United States earlier this year. A ban that continues to this day. Continues. So we get the word out, but it’s not a fair situation. Very, very bad for this country. Very bad for the world. If they can do it to me, they can do it to anyone. And in fact that is exactly what they’re doing. They’re taking people off who don’t even realize they were taken off. They’d have no idea why they were taken off. But what they are doing is incredible and incredibly dangerous.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (19:42)\n",
      "Joining us this morning are just a few of the many Americans who have been illegally banned or silenced under the corrupt regime of censorship. These brave patriots are included in the lawsuit and thousands more are joining as we speak. Thousands more. They’re all wanting to join. This will be, I think will go down as the biggest class action ever filed, because thousands of people want to join. Jen Horton is a schoolteacher from Fenton, Michigan. Earlier this year, she was kicked off Facebook for sharing a post questioning whether young children should be required to wear masks. She had a question. Giving both sides and actually not negative, just giving both sides. That was enough. At the same time, as Jen was de-platformed, her brother had gone missing and she was unable to get the word out to all of her followers. She had a lot of followers. Could not get the word out. And Jen, I want to thank you very much for being here and stepping forward. It takes a lot of courage. Would you like to come up and say something? Jen? Where’s Jen?\n",

Great person who was asked by the pastor of a church to prepare a video about how to mitigate risks of the China virus to allow church services to safely resume. Just a question. Could you give us some information? The video was outrageously removed from Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube with horrible statements being made by them. Kelly, thank you for your bravery. Please say a few words. Thank you.\n",

Going into Newark. Kelly [inaudible 00:22:40] and Bobby Michael, are angel parents. Their precious son Brandon was killed at just 21 years of age by a twice deported and very violent illegal alien. He caused a very fatal collision. Something should have never happened. Since then, they have heroically launched their own deeply personal fight to draw attention to the dangers of illegal immigration. They helped push through Florida’s ban on deadly sanctuary cities and they are indeed deadly. And they continue to be strong advocates for border security and immigration enforcement, but they have been cruelly and unfairly banned from Twitter. Would you like to say a few words? Where are you?\n",

Sue them sir, sue them and they’ve been saying it to me for a long time, but there has never been a better time to do it. Polling released by Scott Rasmussen, highly respected, shows that nearly two thirds of Americans believe big tech companies should be required to abide by the first amendment guarantee of free speech and I think those numbers are low, very low. 68% of Americans believe social media companies should prioritize their fair treatment of every citizen over protecting themselves. They want people protected. They want people to have their voice and an overwhelming majority believe that tech giants have become too powerful. They’ve crossed the line many, many times and by far too much.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (25:11)\n",
      "The American people’s birthright of freedom must prevail against big tech and other forces that seek to destroy it. Through this lawsuit, we are standing up for American democracy, by standing up for free speech rights of every American, Democrat, Republican, independent, whoever it may be. This lawsuit is just the beginning. It’s a very big suit with great lawyers. I’ll let you know about that in about a year from now. Maybe I’ll change my mind, but I don’t think so. They’ve had a tremendous track record in doing good. We’ll also take this battle to the state legislatures, to Congress and ultimately to the ballot box and it will be a very popular one at the ballot box. I will never stop fighting to defend constitutional rights and sacred liberties of the American people. I will never stop. I will now ask John Coale and Pam Bondi, two terrific people that love our country so much, to step forward and discuss the suit and then we’ll take a few questions. Thank you very much.\n",
      "John Coale: (26:34)\n",
      "Hello. He’s taller than me. This suit is really about freedom of speech. It’s basic that freedom of speech depends on certain things. One is, who decides what’s hate? Who decides what’s misinformation? It’s not a couple guys out in California. It’s always been the Supreme Court for over 200 years and I would say, they’ve done a heck of a job. We’re taking this suit. We’re going to prove that they are government actors, therefore the first amendment does apply and we think we will be victorious on that. We think that we’re in the right area, which is southern Florida and you have to understand that we can’t let this happen because for all you out there who are Democrats and liberals or whatever you are, you’re next. Now it’s the conservatives, but as history shows of, it will turn. Maybe five years from now, maybe three months from now, maybe 10 years, but you’re next.\n",
      "John Coale: (27:49)\n",
      "I would urge people from the other side of President Trump’s political party to join us because you can’t have this going on. One last thing, the most hated thing by all the Supreme courts over all the years is called prior restraint. That means that you can’t speak, Pentagon papers is the famous case. You can’t do this because we say so. The Supreme court hates this. They think it’s the worst kind of censorship we have and when this gentlemen can not go on and say what he wants to say, that’s prior restraint, every minute of every day until this thing gets resolved. Thank you.\n",
      "Pam Bondi: (28:43)\n",
      "I’m here, not as part of that great legal team over there, but I’m very proud to be part of America First Policy constitutional litigation team. I was here just to explain just a few things and you know what John said, this is about our constitution. This isn’t just for conservatives. This is for our media. This is for everyone out there about censorship. This is for Democrats and even progressive’s who speech should be protected under the first amendment. If you recall, Tulsi Gabbard she sued. Do you remember that? Tulsi Gabbard was censored when she was running for president and so she sued. People say that they have immunity, they meaning YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, under section 230. Well, here’s where that’s changed. Section 230 came about in 1996 and it was an offshoot of the Decency Act to protect really, to protect against children being exploited online. That’s what this was all about.\n",
      "Pam Bondi: (29:45)\n",
      "Take it back to ’96. How many users were there then? Probably about 20 million on AOL, right president? 1996. Now what do we have? Facebook, Twitter, we have billions world wide. Times have changed. The internet is flourishing, but first amendment still must be protected. No one could envision what was about to happen with the internet and our country now with billions, billions of users worldwide. That’s why this is so important. When you have Mark Zuckerberg and others being called in front of Congress and being coerced and being questioned by all these congressmen, then you also have Mark Zuckerberg emailing with Dr. Fauci about COVID and in fact, a lot of their emails that we received have been redacted, not just because of phone numbers, but because they were trading trade secrets. A private company is communicating with the federal government and parts of that were redacted. They’re not immune anymore. They are not immune anymore. It was coercion, collusion, working together and they cannot hide from the first amendment. That’s why this is so very, very important.\n",
      "Pam Bondi: (31:09)\n",
      "Even Facebook’s oversight board, that Mark Zuckerberg created, the oversight board came back and said there were problems. There were problems and it lacked consistently being applied to everyone by community standards. That’s why this is so important for us, for our future, for all political parties, for all human beings around the world. We believe in the first amendment and America First Policy will fight for it. Thank you.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (31:40)\n",
      "Thank you very much. A lot of people ask me about Dr. Fauci. I like Dr. Fauci. I actually get along with him great, but they said, why didn’t you fire him? I said, no, he was good. He’d recommend something, I’d do the opposite and we always turned out to be right. Sir, don’t close the borders to China. We closed them very early. Get no credit for anything, but these are minor details. Any questions? Christina, yes. I chose you. Go ahead please.\n",
      "Christina: (32:10)\n",
      "Thank you sir. What is the possibility of a settlement prior to trial? Obviously any court ruling in your favor and you’ve laid out a very compelling case. Anything prior to a court ruling would certainly limit the rest, everybody else who’s not in the class.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (32:26)\n",
      "We’re not looking for a settlement. We don’t expect a settlement. They fight and they fight hard. They’ve never had anything like this and they’ve never had a team of very attractive looking people in every way. Look at that. That’s a quite a legal team. That’s like from a picture, but they are very effective, much more importantly, legal team. We’re not looking to settle. We don’t know what’s going to happen, but we’re not looking to settle. Thank you, Christina.\n",

      "Donald Trump: (33:04)\n",
      "It’s such a great question. They are terrible. They are terrible. It’s not only what they say, it’s what they don’t say. For instance, I was informed that there are record numbers of murders took place this weekend. Record numbers. They don’t even talk about it on NBC and CBS and ABC and NPR. They don’t talk about it and it’s a big story. That’s why the credibility of the mainstream media is the lowest it’s ever been. Lowest it’s ever been. I hate to take credit for this, but I’m very proud of the fact that I exposed them for what they are. They are terrible, terrible representatives of our country. They don’t talk about crime. They don’t talk about Chicago where you had 260 people shot this weekend. In Afghanistan we didn’t lose one soldier in the last more than a year. I will say that was largely because of me, but I won’t take credit, but the good news is I will never be given credit either, but we haven’t lost a soldier. Think of it. 260 people shot in Chicago, massive numbers of people shot in New York and they don’t prosecute these people. These are killers. They don’t prosecute these people. They only go after Republicans. It’s a terrible thing that’s happening in our country and a very dangerous thing and a very good question. Please, please.\n",
      "Speaker 4: (34:36)\n",
      "How you doing? How do you fight the argument that these are private companies? They can be as liberal as they want to be.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (34:41)\n",
      "Well, they say that they’re private, but they’re no longer private. If they gave up their section 230 liability protection, I would go along with them. I’d say that private. We’ll open up other privates and other privates will be opened up. I mean, I know that for a fact because I’m involved in that, but I will say that they have section 230. It’s a liability protection, the likes of which nobody in the history of our country has ever received, just as small group and we’re not going to stand for it and that makes them, in my opinion, very subject to the kind of penalties that we’re talking about, which is potentially, John, trillions of dollars. It’s a number that the likes of which nobody’s seen before. John, you might want to address that.\n",
      "John Coale: (35:25)\n",
      "The Supreme Court over the years, especially recently, has been very clear what you can and can’t do as a private company. They’ve done it all. There’s mainly three reasons. The president has talked about the immunity. There’s also the coercion by Congress, Congressman, Congresswomen, in the media and in testimony and in their tweets. There’s also the fact that when this law was passed, Zuckerberg was in middle school. It has served its purpose.\n",
      "John Coale: (36:03)\n",
      "It’s a middle school, okay? It has served its purpose. Now it has grown into this monster that Congress never intended. And the real bottom line is Congress cannot delegate what it can’t do itself. And that’s what they’ve done.\n",
      "Pam Bondi: (36:23)\n",
      "We were talking earlier about when 230 was created in 1996 and really I believe one of the main reasons was something we all care deeply about. But as a former attorney general getting the sex predators off instantly. Yet today there are still… This may have come out during the congressional testimony, but there are still there were over 16 million reports still of sex predators, of sex exploitation of children online. 45 million photos and videos that are allegedly still out there. That’s what they need to be focusing on.\n",
      "Speaker 5: (37:09)\n",
      "Thank you, Mr. President. I think the timing of this is perfect, especially going to the midterms and looking ahead to 2024. Can you share your thoughts on the timing of it and how this decision can help protect conservative viewpoints as we move further to 2024 elections?\n",
      "Donald Trump: (37:25)\n",
      "The timing just seemed to be right, because they’ve been so abusive, so bad what they’ve done. Not only to the president of the United States, but to so many others. Hamas has a site. The greatest killers in the world have a site. They are never reprimanded, they are never red-flagged. Nothing ever happens. And again, get the quote you won’t believe it, but these people call for the destruction of Israel, the destruction of the USA, nothing happens to them. And I just think its become so flagrant and so outrageous and outrageously ridiculous that this was a good time. Not having to do with the elections, I think this will go on beyond the elections. I would be surprised if it didn’t. But I think it’s a very important thing for our nation. Very, very important. Yeah please go ahead, please.\n",
      "Speaker 6: (38:17)\n",
      "Just to clarify, who should be the arbiter of what’s hate, what’s offensive, what should not be published? What goes beyond free speech? And because so much of this your banning has to do with comments you made around January 6th, just to clarify further, what did you do to stop the insurrection as some people call it and why were you not able to stop it?\n",
      "Donald Trump: (38:41)\n",
      "So that whole event, unfortunate event just went through Congress and a report was issued and my name wasn’t even mentioned. And I appreciate that. I was surprised frankly because I would have assumed that they would have come up with their typically biased, at least on the Democrat side statement. The report came out as you saw it two weeks ago. My name wasn’t even mentioned, that was an unfortunate event. I say though however, people are being treated unbelievably unfairly. When you look at people in prison and nothing happens to Antifa and they burned down cities and killed people. There were no guns in the Capitol except for the gun that shot Ashli Babbitt. And nobody knows who that men were.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (39:26)\n",
      "If that were the opposite way that man would be all over, he would be the most well-known and I believe I can say man, because I believe I know exactly who it is. But he would be the most well known person in this country, in the world. But the person that shot Ashli Babbitt right through the head, just boom. There was no reason for that. And why isn’t that person being opened up and why isn’t that being studied? They’ve already written it off. They said that case is closed. If that were the opposite, that case would be going on for years and years and it would not be pretty. So I just thought this was a very important time. Yeah please go ahead. Go ahead please.\n",
      "Speaker 7: (40:12)\n",
      "If you’re successful with this and Twitter and Facebook and Instagram and all of the social media platforms let you back on and let everyone else back on uninhibited the way that everyone’s supposed to have access, would you use their platforms again?\n",
      "Donald Trump: (40:25)\n",
      "I don’t know. That’s a good question. I don’t know I might not. I’m in a different position because if I put out a press release, I’m getting extremely good pickup, but that’s me. The world, everybody that’s getting banned they can’t put out a press release. People would say who the hell is that? Nobody’s going to pick it up. And even myself I could instantaneously get the word out. If somebody says a lie, like the fake media, I can at least give the opposing side which I’ve been doing for six years. I used to get great publicity before I ran for office. I’ve been doing this for five or six years where I can get a word out an opposing word, today you can’t do that. They took away the rights of in my opinion the majority, I really believe it’s the majority because people aren’t for all of these things.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (41:14)\n",
      "Now they have voter ID. That’s another one when you talk about voter ID all of a sudden they love voter ID. They fought it vehemently. I noticed two days ago, I watched a congressmen happened to be from South Carolina saying “No, I’ve always been in favor of voter ID.” Well, he hasn’t because you look at his statement for the last two years he’s been vehemently opposed, but now they lie like nobody has ever lied. I watched him say, “I’ve always believed in voter ID essentially.” And I said that’s unbelievable. Fortunately the particular newscast had his statements from before of which they were too numerous to put up, but they put up enough of them. But the Democrats are now saying because they saw it was an 88% positive issue. They’re now saying we believe in voter ID, we have to have voter ID. There isn’t one Democrat in the country that said that.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (42:07)\n",
      "And in a year from now the fake news will say they’ve always been on this side, it’s amazing. If you say it long enough, hard enough, often enough people will start to believe it. That’s what happened with Russia, that’s what happened with Ukraine. That’s what happened with… Well, the worst is when they don’t say it like the laptop from hell. They didn’t want it. You look at that thing there is more criminal activity on that laptop than Al Capone had if he ever had a laptop. We’d like to give Al Capone one, but he was a baby compared to what I was able to see. Brooke would you like to say a few more words?\n",
      "Speaker 8: (42:47)\n",
      "What’s going to happen if somebody joined the lawsuit?\n",
      "Donald Trump: (42:48)\n",
      "That’s a good question, Brooke.\n",
      "Brooke Rollins: (42:50)\n",
      "You can join the law suit by going to takeonbigtech.com. I did not plant that question, but I very much appreciate it. Takeonbigtech.com and we really are looking for the tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of Americans. And let me just say one quick thing. It was a great question about the political ramifications of this lawsuit versus two years or four years. And certainly it will be part of the national narrative I think moving forward for the next couple of years. But this effort really is about the battle for the future of this country. And when we lose the opportunity to be part of a public discourse, whether as conservatives, as Republicans, as libertarians, as fighting against critical race theory, as questioning masks and whether our 11, 13, 15 and 16 year olds, my children should be forced to wear a mask all day.\n",
      "Brooke Rollins: (43:40)\n",
      "Whether we’re questioning illegal immigration and how to use that, that’s crazy and it’s not okay and this is not America. And it is not the America that I know we all want for our children and our future grandchildren. And that’s what this lawsuit is about. We have the best legal team in the country. The America First Policy Institute is partnering with them to ensure that the word gets out, that we can truly truly give our Americans who have been censored, who have been compromised, who have been told that they don’t have a voice that will no longer be the case. So thank you. Thank you all\n",
      "John Coale: (44:15)\n",
      "I want to make one thing, the gentleman asked who would decide what’s hate speech, who would decide this thing. For 200 years, over 200 years it’s been the Supreme court. We can’t let it be in the hands of unelected people or unappointed justices. But they have done such a good job for 200 years on this issue. We don’t need any panels. We don’t need any oversight committees. We need the Supreme court and the judicial system to come into the 21st century.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (44:52)\n",
      "So I want to thank everybody. It’s about 94 degrees out. I’m sorry to do this. It was supposed to be a beautiful day, 72 and perfect and it’s a little bit hot. We’re going to have refreshments, drinks we’ll bring you into the club house if you’d like. But we’ll take care of you because I see some of you are in serious trouble sitting there. I do hope I could leave you with two things. Number one, this is a very important lawsuit. This is a big time long awaited, very, very long awaited. The complexity of it I guess took a longer period of time, but other litigants also want to join in with us and we have great confidence in the courts and we’re going to see what happens. And the other thing I just asked the mainstream media to go back and do on network news and everywhere else please discuss the horrors of what’s going on in… Out in Chicago. It’s a number. It’s a stat put out by the city over the weekend. There’s no war that we lost that many and for a long time and many people died, young people. And New York is a horror show. New York has the worst crime wave that they’ve had ever and nothing’s done about it, except no bail. They let everybody out of prison.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (46:23)\n",
      "They just left almost 500 people out. They let them all out. They caused tremendous damage and harm and physical harm to other people and death. And they let them out. If the people don’t hear this you’ll never be able to solve the problem. It’s a problem like this country has never had. What’s happened over the last six months in particular and what’s happening in certain cities is a horrible thing. It’s an embarrassment to our country, but more importantly it’s just a horrible thing. The loss of human life on a weekly basis and you turn on these major newscasts that a lot of people are watching and it’s not even mentioned. You have to change. You got to get you credibility back. You don’t have the credibility, you have to get it back. I want to thank everybody very much and we’ll be seeing what happens. John good luck, Pam good luck, everybody. Trish I want to thank you for being so great. You’re really fantastic. I appreciate it very much. You’ve been so incredible. Thank you. And thank you-\n",

      "Thank you very much to Lee. Thank you, Lee. Well, he’s been so great. Michael, thank you very much and congratulations on your reelection today as chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party. We love this state. You’ve done a great job, Michael, and we thank you very much. We really appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. I love you too. I love you too.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (02:31)\n",
      "It’s great to be back in Greenville with so many proud North Carolina Patriots who love our country, support our military, respect our police, honor our flag and always put America first. We don’t put America second. As we gather tonight, our country is being destroyed before our very own eyes. Crime is exploding. Police departments are being ripped apart and defunded. Can you believe that? Is that good politics, defund our police? Number one, it’s bad for our country, but think of it, defund our police. You know, I’ve long said they’re vicious, they’re violent. They in many cases, hate our country and they have bad policy. Now, the bad news from our standpoint, they stick together. They don’t have some of the people like we have where they go on their own and they do what they have to. They stick together, and that’s the one thing they have. They stick together, but their policy is so bad.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (03:34)\n",
      "We’re going to have a tremendous 2022, just like we did frankly, 2020. Think of it. More votes than any sitting president in the history of the United States by far. We had a great election. Bad things happened, but we had a great election. You look at our border, is wide open. Illegal immigration is skyrocketing at a level that we’ve never seen before, and this is over a period of a few months. Drugs are pouring in. Gas prices are soaring. Our industries are being pillaged by foreign cyber attacks. That’s a lack of respect for our country and for our leaders. Speaking of our leaders, they’re bowing down to China. America is being demeaned and humiliated on the world stage. Our freedom is being overtaken by left wing cancel culture, and the Biden administration is pushing toxic critical race theory and illegal discrimination into our children’s schools.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (04:39)\n",
      "Now you tell me, we take this? Joe Biden and the Socialist Democrats are the most radical left-wing administration in history. Even Bernie Sanders can’t believe it. He said, I can’t believe this happened. This is worse than I ever was. I don’t know if they even know what the hell they’re signing. Somebody is drawing these documents and putting it, and it’s getting signed. It’s a disgrace what’s happening to our country. The survival of America depends upon our ability to elect Republicans at every level, starting with the midterms next year. We have to get it done. We have to get it done. We have no choice, actually. We have to get it done. Together, we’re going to defend our freedoms. You just take a look at what’s happening. We have to defend our borders. We have to do all of these things and the cancel culture, the defunding culture, the defending culture and they defend the wrong things, we’re not going to let it go any longer. Going to stand up for our values. We have to stand up for our values, and we’re going to take back our country and we’re going to take it back at a level that is very, very good for our country and it’s good for citizens because we can’t allow bad things to happen to our country. Bad, bad things are happening to us, perhaps like never before. You’ll be seeing what goes on and perhaps like never before.\n",

Stand up, Mark. Good job. Thank you. Thank you, Mark. We’re also joined by some of your terrific representatives in Congress. I think Virginia Fox is here, who I just endorsed. Where’s Virginia? She’s around here someplace. Virginia, thank you very much. Thank you, Virginia. I thought, Virginia, you should have a better seat than that. I’m sorry. A great guy and a friend of mine, a tremendous supporter, David Rouser. David, thank you very much. Thank you, David. Dan Bishop, right from the beginning, been so good. Thank you. Thank you, Dan. Great job. We had a big victory that night. Didn’t we, Dan? Huh? They said, I don’t know if he’s going to win. He won. He won big.\n",

Where is our Madison? Thank you, Madison. Thank you. What a great guy. What a good future you’ve got. Where the hell is Madison? Thank you, Madison. Great job. Thank you very much. If I had a face like him, I would have been president 20 years earlier. 20 years earlier, Madison. Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you. Greg Murphy. Where’s Greg? Thank you, Greg. You’re doing a really great job. We’re proud of you. A friend of mine and somebody that’s really been incredible, respected by everybody, congressman Ted Budd. Where’s Ted?Good job, Ted. Good job. Here as well are two people that you may know of, actually, I probably like her better because she was a supporter of mine before he was. People don’t know that. Deb Meadows, stand up. Stand up, Deb. We have to say Deb, he wasn’t far behind. It wasn’t like many, many months. No, he had somebody else in mind, but he switched over very quickly. I don’t know if he had a choice. Right, Deb? Mark Meadows, everybody, a real great guy.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (09:24)\n",
      "With the spirit and energy and commitment of everyone in this room and the voters all across this state, 2022 is going to be a banner year for North Carolina Republicans. You know, they said this state was… If you look back 10 years ago, Michael, they said this state was finished. It was not going to be a Republican state at all, and they had elected a Governor, and it really looked bad. Then these guys, some of them that I just announced but others also, we all got together, and you’ve never been in a stronger position, and now you’re going to have another Senator. We just elected a wonderful friend of ours, and Tom is going to be great. I think Tom, he got off to a little rocky start with protect Bob Mueller, but you know what, he flipped in the other direction totally, and he’s been terrific. He had a great race. He ran a great race. He really did, and he had my total support. He called me just a little while ago to tell me, enjoy the state because I love the state. I love being in this state. I just want to say that this was going to be a Democrat state, and here we are and we’re really dominating when you look at everything that’s happened, so congratulations. It’s really great. To you, congratulations.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (10:38)\n",
      "I think we’re going to gain two or even three US House seats. We’re going to take over, if you look over the House today and get rid of Nancy Pelosi. Remember, they stick together. On an impeachment hoax, not one Democrat, not one voted against. Well actually, we had one that came over to our side who is a terrific person, actually, but you take a look and they didn’t want to do that, but they just do it a little bit differently. They play very tough, very dirty, and we just can’t let it happen. We’re going to win north Carolina’s all important US Senate race, and we’re going to lay the groundwork for making sure that Republicans, once again, carry the great state of North Carolina, in a number, a year, that I look very much forward to, 2024.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (11:34)\n",
      "We’re going to do numbers like you’ve never seen before. So many things are happening right now, but they’re… We’re going to do things like you’ve never, ever seen before. I stand before you today, confident that the people of North Carolina will decisively reject Joe Biden and the radical Democrats, the war on the American worker, the American family and the American nation. I have to tell you that I have a very special person, she’s been… I love my family. I love my family. I happen to love this particular young man that she’s married to. He’s a very tall person by the way, but not as tall as Baron. Baron is six foot seven, can you believe it, and he’s 15. Eric is short. He’s only six foot six, but we love our Eric and we love them all. They’re all great. He is married to a very special woman, Lara, and I’d like to have her… You know, she was born in this particular state. She loves this particular state, and maybe I’d like to ask Laura Trump to come up and say a few words. Laura, please. Come on up.\n",
      "Lara Trump: (13:15)\n",
      "Okay, my people. Can we just start off really quickly, and I’ll keep this brief, but Donald Trump is two and O in the state of North Carolina folks. How about it? Not bad. I got to thank all of you because I promised my father-in-law that we would win this state for him, and we won it in two elections, so thanks to all of you. I really, you guys know, I was born and raised in this state. I absolutely love the state of North Carolina. My parents, Bob and Linda are here with my brother, Kyle. They drove in from Wilmington to be here tonight. My brother graduated from ECU right here in Greenville. He’s a pirate. This state truly made me the person that I am today. I love this state so much, I named my daughter Carolina. Okay? I don’t want any of you UNC fans to get any ideas because y’all know I’m Wolf Pack for life. All right? I just want to set that one straight.\n",
      "Lara Trump: (14:23)\n",
      "Now, you may have heard a rumor that I have been considering possibly running for a Senate seat here in North Carolina. I have been considering it, and it’s a big decision in case nobody knew. It’s a very big deal, and look, it’s something I did a lot of soul searching, a lot of thinking, talking with my father-in-law, my parents, my husband, Eric, and because of the values my parents instilled in me, they taught me that when you do something, you give 100%. That is the only way to operate. Because of my two kids who are very young, one and three, Carolina and Luke, it is going to be very hard for me to enter this Senate race right now, but I am saying no for now, not no forever, just so you know.\n",
      "Lara Trump: (15:17)\n",
      "I came here tonight with my father-in-law because there is a very special person who is going to do an amazing job as your next Senator from the state of North Carolina, that he is going to announce tonight here in this room. I can promise you this: just because my name is not on the ballot does not mean I am not fighting every step of the way with you here in North Carolina because if we’re being honest, this is so much bigger than a Senate seat. It’s about the future of America. We have to fight for our conservative values. We have to have a person in that Senate seat who represents North Carolina and is going to lead this country in the right direction.\n",
      "Lara Trump: (16:00)\n",
      "I want to say thank you to everybody. I have so much support and so many people that were so sweet and poured out so much love for me with the thought of me possibly running, so again, no for now, not no forever. At the right time, I would absolutely love to come back and consider running for something here in my home state because I love it dearly. Before I turn it back over to my father-in-law, here’s what I want to say. We are two and O, but what do you say we go three and O, guys?Let’s do it. I love you guys. Thank you.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (00:09)\n",
      "Oh, those polls, if you believe in those polls, Lara. But she also explained I love my family. I love your son. I love those beautiful children and I have to take care of them. And there’s something very refreshing about that. I don’t hear that from everyone. Sadly, I hear a lot of the opposite actually, but that’s why you’re such a special part of the family because you look at the numbers and you look at the polls and the love that this state has for you. It’s incredible. So thank you. And I’ve been putting a little pressure. I said, “Make your decision please,” because we have to pick somebody. And what I don’t want is I don’t want a lot of people joining a race that are big Trump supporters and then I have to go with somebody because there’s somebody in this room that I think is very special. Somebody that I’ve worked with, always been with me, always been with Mark and Deb and all of us.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:04)\n",
      "He’s a man that hasn’t been pushing me at all, unlike some of the others that are running, that won’t win. They won’t win. We have another race after this one. This man’s a great politician, but more importantly, he’s somebody that loves the state of North Carolina. He loves the country and I’m going to do it now, because again, I don’t want a lot of people running and then they’re going to be disappointed. And in many cases, they’re friends of mine. They’re great people, they’re thinking about running. They want to run and they wanted to wait, frankly, till Lara made her decision, because she would have been tough. She would have been tough.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:37)\n",
      "And she’s very outstanding, but I think she did the right thing for her and for our family. But this gentleman is going to be your next senator. He’s going to be somebody that you’re going to be so proud of. He will fight like hell, would you agree with that Mark? He will fight like nobody fights. And a lot of you don’t know him that well, but you’re going to know him probably within about two minutes. Ted Budd, please come up, please come up, please come up, Ted. I am giving him my complete and total endorsement. We’re going to work with him. We’re going to campaign with him. You can’t pick people that have already lost two races. You can’t pick people that have already lost two races and do not stand for our values. So I’m going with Congressman Ted Budd, complete and total endorsement. Come on up, Ted.\n",
      "Ted Budd: (02:38)\n",
      "Thank you Mr. President, thank you. Wow, Mr. President, thank you so much. And go back to 2016, I was in a 17 way race and won that primary and got here. I was the business guy that never run for office. I think maybe had an 18 way primary, right? 18 way. We came in and we fought for their forgotten men and women of America. And Lara, I think you’re out there, your father-in-law and you, you fought for me in 2018. The Dems outspent me two to one in the worst Republican district. And with your help, Mr. President and Lara, you coming in to help, we won. In 2020, Lara, we fought together. We fought to help Thom Tillis win, we fought to keep the North Carolina legislature, we fought for North Carolina judges. You’re a heck of a teammate and you’d be a heck of a Senator. Mr. President, Lara, this means the world to me. Thank you. We got a lot of hard work ahead. So let’s win this together and let’s get back to making America great again.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (04:12)\n",
      "Well, thank you very much, Ted. Honestly, he did not know about this until about 15 minutes before I walked to the podium and he was very taken by it. And I have read this on numerous occasions, so I’m not saying it myself, the wonderful… That’s a lot of media. That’s good. It’s hard for them to cancel when you get great ratings, isn’t it. They may edit that out. They don’t want to have that. They don’t like that. They may have to edit that out, Ted, but that’s okay. They don’t like those endorsements, but we’ve been very, very successful. Literally hundreds to one, hundreds to two in terms of the endorsements and the power of the endorsement, because people respect that I do want to make America great again. We were doing that. We were doing that at a level that nobody’s ever seen and putting America first ahead of China and ahead of all of these countries.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (05:17)\n",
      "And people know that, that’s where we were. And before the pandemic came into our shores, we were doing numbers. In history, there’s never been anything like it. Unemployment for everybody, for every group, everybody was the best it’s ever been. We’re up to 160 million people. We were never even close to a number like that. And then we had this horrible thing come in from China. And we got that one right too, by the way, do you notice, you see what’s going on over the last, it’s called the lab, that was an easy one. Wuhan. But you had this horrible problem come in. And like every other country, we went down and they were saying how well India was, look how well India is doing. Well, India is not doing too well now. And we’ve done an incredible job. And most importantly, with the vaccine coming up with it, but we’ve done an incredible job.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (06:09)\n",
      "So many things have happened and we built the economy not once, we built it twice, think of it because we built it. We had the highest stock market ever, the best job numbers. And then we had to regroup. We had to do a lot of things. We became the ventilator factory of the world. We were making them for everybody. Our cupboards were bare. The federal cupboards were bare and the state cupboards were bare and we’ve done a tremendous job. We never got the kind of credit that we deserve for that. One thing we do get the credit for, from everybody, even the other side, although they try and disparage it as much as possible, was the vaccine, coming up with a vaccine, but we did something else that people don’t talk about it. I made a bet and I shouldn’t call it a bet because maybe you say speculation, as opposed, but it was somewhat of a bet.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (06:58)\n",
      "We bought billions and billions of dollars worth of vaccine and all forms of getting that vaccine into your body. The needles, the bottles, the whole thing. We bought millions and billions actually of dollars worth of the vaccine. And we saved a period of a year, maybe more, you wouldn’t have the vaccine right now. This room would be empty because they would ask me to be here and I would say, “No, thank you.” And you would say the same thing. This would be an empty room right now. And your state would be in a lot of trouble and the country would be in a lot of trouble because you wouldn’t have the vaccine until probably October. It might’ve even been later than that. And one of the things I’m most proud about is we did the vaccine, developed the vaccine, and I pushed the FDA. They have never been pushed would you say, Mark Meadows?\n",
      "Donald Trump: (07:46)\n",
      "They have never been pushed like that. He was there at a lot of those meetings. Those were not nice meetings. They do not like me too much, that I can tell you. And frankly, the drug companies don’t like me too much either because I did a thing called favored nations where we have to pay whatever the lowest is in the world. That’s what we have to pay. Nobody can believe I instituted that. If they leave it alone, you’ll soon have the lowest drug prices that we’ve ever had by… But that doesn’t mean that they like me. They spend millions of dollars against me and that’s okay. They have to do what they have to do, but we did things that nobody has ever done. I’m very proud of the biggest bet. This was maybe the greatest bet ever made in the history of the world because we saved a year.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (08:26)\n",
      "We bought billions of dollars of this vaccine before we even knew it worked. And because of that, most of you, I guess, all of you, just about, in one form or another, you’ve had your shots or jabs as they like to call it. I actually like the other word better, but we’ve saved a lot of lives. We’ve saved all over the world. We’ve saved millions and millions of lives and we’re very proud of it. And nobody can ever take it away from us because that’s something that’s very, very special. And the people in this room are very, very special. The Biden administration seems to be putting America last. You look at these negotiations where so many bad things have happened. 48,000 jobs were lost by president Biden’s day one rejection of the Keystone XL pipeline. Why? For what reason did they do that?\n",
      "Donald Trump: (09:21)\n",
      "And if you like the environment, the pipeline is much better than railroad tracks and it’s much better than trucking. It’s great. And they ended it on just about day one, 48,000 jobs, not 8,000. They said 8,000, it’s 48,000. Think of it. He rejected our pipeline, but he approved the Russian pipeline, which I had completely stopped going into Germany and all parts of Europe. So I stopped Russia and I have a very good relationship with President Putin, but there’s never been anybody as tough on Russia than I was. And you look at these horrible cyber attacks. You look at all of the things that are happening. We’re in a different world than we were in just a few months ago. Yet there’s no better example of Biden’s failed agenda than the catastrophic, and you look at it what’s going on with the southern border. Is there anything that you’ve ever seen, like what’s going on, on the southern border? And people are coming in from South America, Latin America, but they’re coming in from the Middle East.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (10:24)\n",
      "They’re coming in from all over. When I left office, we gave the new administration the most secure border in US history. We had the most secure border in the history of our country and that included drugs, that included human trafficking, which is a magnificently horrible and big business, mostly trafficking in women. And the numbers were down to levels that they hadn’t seen in many, many years. And all they had to do is just leave it alone. Just leave it alone. If you leave it alone, it would have gotten better and better. And the fact that we built almost 500 miles of wall, and just a few months, it would have been completed, took two and a half years of litigation to get to build the wall and what an impact it had. But it would have been completed, totally completed in just a couple of months.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (11:18)\n",
      "And they stopped it. Now I understand they’re starting it again. That one was just too easy, but wait till they find out, hey, wait till they see what those contractors are going to do to them. Well this is going to cost us five times more money now because we weren’t prepared. It’s the old story. They’re the greatest negotiators in the world. They may not have gone to the greatest business schools, but they’re the greatest negotiators. But we negotiated historic agreements with Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, to stop illegal immigration. We ended asylum and asylum fraud. The fraud of what was going on at our border was unbelievable. We instituted rapid removals on the border and that’s really rapid. I call it one day turnaround of criminals coming into our country, sending people home in record time. We have times that nobody ever heard of before. We ended catch and release.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (12:17)\n",
      "That’s where you catch somebody, could be a horrible criminal. You catch somebody, a rapist, a murderer, could be a drug dealer. And we release them. It’s called catch. We catch them and we release them into our country. Well, we didn’t do that. We empowered ICE to do their jobs. ICE is incredible. The border patrol is incredible. By the way, your police force in North Carolina, I’ve gotten to know very well. They are incredible. Thank you very much. A lot of them are here tonight. We cracked down on sanctuary cities, deported gang members by the thousands, and dealt a crippling blow to MS-13, that’s the most vicious gang of all. And we took them out of here by the thousands. Thousands and thousands brought back to where they came and those countries didn’t want them back. And a little story. I said, “Well, what do you mean they don’t want them back?”\n",
      "Donald Trump: (13:15)\n",
      "They weren’t taking them back. They didn’t want them back. They sent them out. They didn’t want them back. And I said, “That’s bad.” And they told me that, “Sir, we can’t take them. They won’t let us land planes. They’re putting other planes on the runway. So we can’t land planes. They won’t take the buses.” I say, “How much do we pay those countries?” “Sir, we pay them $500 million a year.” “Oh, you do? Tell them we’re not paying them anymore.” And the next day I got a call from all three countries. “We’d love to have Ms-13 back. We think they’re wonderful people. We never had a problem.” And now they blew that one too. They blew that one too. I’ll never forget it. “We’d love to have them back. It would be a great honor to take them back.” Those runways opened up like you’ve never seen anything open up.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (13:59)\n",
      "After we instituted these policies, the number of illegal aliens coming across our border declined by an astounding 91%. But under Joe Biden, illegal crossings are up nearly 1000% compared to the same period last year. They’re emptying their prisons. They’re sending murderers, drug dealers, human traffickers, and others just as bad to the United States. Let the United States take care of them. Remember it’s called America last. In April alone, over 175,000 illegal aliens were apprehended and mostly released. You know where they were released, right? They were released into our country and we saw the largest number ever of unaccompanied minors. We’ve never seen anything like it. If you just watch some of the semi-fair tell. You don’t have to watch fair, semi-fair. They talk about it. Because I think they have no choice and I think they’re going to see it more and more.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (14:56)\n",
      "You don’t see it too much on the evening news yet, but you’re going to see it because they’re destroying our country, but it is much worse than that because there are at least 1000 aliens who are simply getting away every single day as the radical Democrats have intentionally, ruthlessly, and systematically dismantle the sovereign borders of the United States of America. We have people just walking into our country. Nobody knows who they are, where they’re from. There’s no vetting, there’s no anything. And some of these people are very, very bad people, much as I said on that beautiful morning when I came down with our future first lady at the time, Melania, who sends her regards. But we came down that beautiful gold escalator in Trump Tower and I made that statement and people hated it. It turned out that my statement was very minor compared to the actual facts.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (15:59)\n",
      "It was very, very minor. It’s another thing we were right about. Without a border, you cannot have a nation, certainly not a great nation. We fight for other country’s borders, but we don’t fight for our own border. Think of it. We fight for other country’s borders, but not for our own. That changed under my administration but now they’re going back more rapidly than anyone ever thought possible. Nobody ever thought that they could do this kind of destruction to our country so quickly. Some of those executive orders that are signed are absolutely insane. Biden has halted wall construction, suspended removals, and even removals of just horrible, horrible people, stopped enforcement, shredded our groundbreaking remain in Mexico. So we had that groundbreaking plan that took us a long time to get, because Mexico, like the other countries, were taking advantage of the United States. Everybody was taken advantage of us and we have an agreement. Stay in Mexico as opposed to stay in the United States.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (17:11)\n",
      "And a lot of people weren’t coming when they realized they had to stay in Mexico. So the enforcement was so much better and it was getting to a level that nobody’s ever seen. And then we finally hit that level. Nobody’s ever seen anything like it. They turned America into a sanctuary for criminal aliens and effectively, they were abolishing ICE through agency directives. What they’ve done to ICE and what they’ve done to our border patrol heroes is incredible. It’s incredible. And these are some of the finest people you’ll ever meet. I got to know so many of them and they’re among the finest people you’ll ever, ever meet. It’s true. They love our country. Despite the worst border crisis in history, we’ve had the smallest number of illegal alien removals ever.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (18:03)\n",
      "… had the smallest number of illegal alien removals ever recorded. 92% of illegal aliens we removed in 2020 had criminal records. You believe that? Over 90 and very substantially probably higher than that. I think around 92% had criminal records. Now, they’re all being set free and released back into your communities. They don’t want to bring them back. If they are back, they actually have a new policy that, if we took them out, they’re going to let them come back in. It’s the most incredible thing I’ve ever heard.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (18:34)\n",
      "But the border is just the beginning of the Biden disasters. As you know, we handed the new administration the greatest economy in the history of the world. We passed massive tax cuts. The largest ever. Larger than our great friend, Ronald Reagan. Record regulation cuts, historic pro-American trade deals, and achieved American energy independence. How’s your gasoline price doing? Actually, I guess, you were hit worse than any state from what I understand on the cyber attack. It’s incredible. It’s a lack of respect. After the pandemic began, we launched the fastest economic recovery on record. We produced three vaccines and numerous therapeutics to defeat the virus. They don’t talk about the therapeutics, but we came up with things that are incredible and I think extremely effective. All Joe Biden had to do was sit back and do nothing and it was taking off like a rocket ship. Nobody’s ever seen it between the economy and all of the other things we did, the border. Instead the economy is going to Hell and inflation is going to cause a catastrophe in the near future. The New York Times, who I don’t often quote, just stated 1,000,000 jobs a month seemed within grasp not long ago. Think of it, 1,000,000 jobs a month seemed within grasp not long ago, but now it looks like wishful thinking. Isn’t that sad? Now, we would have done much better than that. But that’s the New York Times saying it. Monthly jobs numbers have missed expectations the last two months in a row and you saw what was released on Friday. They were devastating numbers, job numbers. Inflation is now at the highest level in 13 years and it’s going to go up very substantially. It’s going to cost you a lot more. Imposing a stealth tax on hard-working Americans and especially on middle income Americans. Biden re-entered the job killing Paris Climate Accord, a terrible deal that is pro-China, pro-Russia, and anti-American and will cost America trillions of dollars over the years. This is a deal that is so one-sided against us like practically no other deal. But they’re all bad, but this one’s a real beauty. But it sounds so nice, right? The Paris Environmental Accord. Gas prices have increased almost 71% since one year ago. Think of it.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (21:18)\n",
      "Democrats are now attempting to pass the largest tax hike in American history and it will affect everybody. They’re saying it’s against the rich. It’s against everybody. A lot of the rich will take off to go to other countries. A lot of the companies that I brought back are going to leave and go back to other countries where they can not have to pay all of their profits out in taxes. They’re talking about the biggest tax hike in history by far.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (21:43)\n",
      "They’re also pushing a $2.25 trillion infrastructure bill that’s not infrastructure. It’s the kind of things that you don’t want. 9% looks like it might be infrastructure, but mostly it’s not infrastructure at all. The Democrat legislation also includes an extreme plan to abolish single family home zoning, which would obliterate your home values, increase crime, and destroy the suburbs all to satisfy the far-left agenda of AOC, Bernie Sanders, Rashida Tlaib, and Ilhan Omar, who is telling us how to run our country. It’s a great experience. She comes from a country that’s done a wonderful job running their country. Now, she’s telling us how to run our country. While Democrats push economic policies designed to punish American workers, Republicans must keep on fighting to protect, promote, and uplift the American worker who we cherish.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (22:53)\n",
      "That begins with standing up to Communist China. Last year, China inflicted an estimated $ 16 trillion of economic damage onto the United States with a virus that I call the China Virus because I want to be accurate, that claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of our fellow citizens. Look at the world. Look at what happened to the world. It’s not just us. It’s the world. Had we not come up with a vaccine, you would have had a 1917 Spanish Flu number. They lost, they say, up to 100 million people. You would have had those kind of numbers. You would have had numbers that are just unthinkable. But because of what we’ve done as a nature and because of the speed that we came up with a vaccine, the world will not have that. Many places in the world are getting better. Even India today announced that they’re starting to heal.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (23:51)\n",
      "The media, the Democrats, and the so-called experts are now finally admitting what I first said 13 months ago. The evidence demonstrates that the virus originated in a Chinese government lab. Couldn’t say it. You couldn’t say it. Dr. Fauci, who I actually got along with, he’s a nice guy, he’s a great promoter. Not a great doctor, but he’s a hell of a promoter. He likes television more than politician in this room and they like television. But he’s been wrong on almost every issue and he was wrong on Wuhan and the lab also. Very wrong. We ended the payments. They were started in 2014 and then I can tell you Mark Meadows came in and I talked to him and he saw what I saw. I said, “What the hell’s going on? When did that start?” It started in 2014 and we ended it, our administration ended it.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (24:50)\n",
      "But generally speaking, I went the opposite way of Dr. Fauci, what he was saying. For instance, Fauci said, “Do not close our borders to China or Europe,” but I did it anyway. Months later, he said I made the right decision and saved thousands and thousands of lives. He said it was the right decision, but he did not want to close that border. I said, “Wait a minute, there’s tremendous infection over there. We can’t let this happen.” We closed it and I think we saved hundreds of thousands of lives. You remember the number? It was 2.2 million people in our country who were expected to die. Fauci said powerfully at the beginning no masks. You remember that? No, masks don’t work. Masks don’t. Then he went into masks and then he became a radical masker. I recall him… If you have three, if you have four. Get a pair of goggles also ideally. Let’s wear them for another five or six years.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (25:48)\n",
      "But Fauci has, perhaps, never been more wrong than when he denied the virus and where it came from. The time has come for America and the world to demand reparations and accountability from the Communist Party of China. We should all declare within one unified voice that China must pay. They must pay. The United States should immediately take steps to phase in a firm 100% tariff on all goods made in China. You saw what was happening with our tariffs. In fact, the Democrats were fighting the tariffs, “Oh, we don’t…” Well, he hasn’t taken those tariffs off. He doesn’t want to. Billions and billions of dollars. 25% tariffs on China. Billions and billions of dollars is pouring in.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (26:51)\n",
      "Frankly, if you raise them, a lot of things would happen to China. I think they’d stop building their military. I think a lot of companies would move back to the United States. I’m not only talking about China. I’m talking about others. Because you know what China does is they’ll sell through other countries. They’re very ingenious. They’re very smart. Had a great relationship with President Xi until the China Virus came in and it was real tough.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (27:16)\n",
      "We made a tremendous deal for the farmers. Farmers are doing better than they’ve ever done because of us, because of me, because of what we’ve done with our administration. Better than they’ve ever done. Look at wheat prices and virtually all prices. The farmers are doing the best and one of the reasons is China is buying tremendous amounts. They want to keep us happy. They want to keep me happy. I don’t think they want to keep Biden happy. I don’t think they care too much about Biden to be honest. But they wanted to keep me happy and they were investing with our farmers. They were buying so much of our product and they continue to do so. We made a great deal.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (27:49)\n",
      "But after the virus came in, I just felt differently. A trade deal with China didn’t mean very much. To me, it was a whole different mindset. Does that make sense? I used to talk about the trade deal. I’d drive these guys crazy. That trade deal was great. Look at our farmers. They’re starting to do great. You look at beef, you look at cattle, you look at all of the different things. Corn, wheat. You look at it. What a great deal. When the virus came in, I don’t even talk about the trade. This is the first time in a long time I’ve even mentioned the trade deal. It’s really been very beneficial. But it’s so tiny compared to the devastation that’s been caused. We should reinvest 100% of all of that money that we collect from tariffs to help bring back jobs and factories from China and other places back to America and back to the great state of North Carolina where they belong.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (28:46)\n",
      "Over the years, I’ve built lots of hotels and lots of things. I used to buy my furniture from North Carolina. Are you a furniture guy? Stand up. There’s only one in the room I think. Right? But I helped you a lot, right? Good. Thank you. It’s great to have you. The quality was incredible. Now it’s so much of it’s made in China, right? So much. We were stopping that. It was all stopping. Then we had to slow it down a little bit after the pandemic, but it was all stopping. It was all starting to come back here and to other places. I will tell you, I bought a lot of furniture, a lot of things. A lot of times, you’d put furniture made in China into a hotel room and it would break. Somebody sits down in a chair. If you don’t sit down lightly, the damn thing would collapse. Then I’d get sued as usual. But nobody ever made it like you made it here and you make it here. So just stay tuned, okay? Because we were all set to bring it all back. It was all coming back.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (29:47)\n",
      "In addition, all nations should work together to present China a bill for a minimum of $10 trillion to compensate for the damage they’ve caused. That’s a very low number. The damage is far, far greater than that. As a first step, all countries should collectively cancel any debt they owe to China as a down payment on reparations. The nations of the world should no longer owe money to China. China has destroyed so many nations. I mean, we came out better than anybody. Our economy’s stronger now than any other nation. Nobody’s recovered like us because of what we’ve done, because we laid a great economic foundation, and because of what we’ve done with a vaccine and also what we’ve done with the distribution of the vaccine. But China should owe money to the nations of the world. They’ve been destroyed. These nations have been destroyed.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (30:45)\n",
      "Sadly, the current administration is very timid and frankly corrupt when you look at all of the money that they’ve been given as a family by China. That, instead of holding China accountable, the Biden Administration shut down the US government’s investigation into the origins of the virus shortly after taking office. What’s going on? Now, Hunter, who had no experience, walked out with $1.5 billion to manage. You know how much money you make on $1.5 billion to manage? They needed Hunter’s advice. They don’t use the smartest people on Wall Street. They don’t want their advice. I spoke to somebody on Wall Street. I won’t mention his name. We’ll get him in trouble. But I spoke to somebody. I said, “Who’s one of the biggest?” I said, “Do they do this?” He said, “I can’t get money.” This guy’s record is better than anybody. Now, that’s a disgrace.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (31:34)\n",
      "We must never forget that Joe Biden and his family took millions of dollars from the Chinese Communist Party. They bought them off. They flagrantly lied about it to the American voters. If you remember, it was a big deal at the time and then all of a sudden, it was canceled. They didn’t want to talk about it. The Big Tech and the fake news media didn’t want to talk about it. You could talk up a storm. In fact, I’ll guarantee you those cameras are starting to go off right now. It’s true. Yeah. Those red lights. Well, there’s one over there. What the hell network are you with? This guy’s going to lose his job. The American voters and now Joe Biden are doing… What they’re doing is just terrible to the American voter and to our great country, our great country.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (32:27)\n",
      "Because we are greater than China. There is nobody like us. Nobody has the people that we have. Nobody has the genius that we have. Nobody has the things or the system that we have when it works, but it’s broken right now. It’s corrupt. It’s broken. Whether it’s elections, whether it’s business, whether it’s taxation. Whether it’s so many different things. Nobody has what our country has. The Biden Administration has been one shameful and embarrassing foreign policy disaster after another. You know the former Secretary of State, he said, “Joe has never made a good foreign policy decision.”\n",
      "Donald Trump: (33:09)\n",
      "Biden cravenly lifted sanctions on Iran. Oh, Iran. Oh. I would have had a deal in one week. One week. I even told them. I said, “You know what? Let’s get the election over with and we’ll make a deal.” It would have been a great deal. Now, they’re actually asking for money. Here we go again. Remember? They got $150 billion plus $1.8 billion in cash. Now, they’re actually asking for money. They never asked me for money. It’s unbelievable. It’s so sad to see. So many things. That’s one.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (33:40)\n",
      "Look at what’s happening with North Korea. Remember when I first came in? We were going to war with North Korea. War is inevitable. Nuclear war we’re talking about. He’s pretty well stocked up and I got along with him. It started out a little rough, but we got along great. I liked him, he liked me. We got along great. You don’t even hear about North Korea. Now, you’re starting to hear. Because he doesn’t seem to like Biden very much. There’s nobody to talk to Kim Jong-un. He’s a different kind of guy. Takes a different kind of a guy to talk to him too, but I got along with him. Got along with him. Remember when I had the meeting? They said, “He’s given so much. He’s given…” I said, “I haven’t given anything.” They said, “Hmm, that’s a problem. All right.” Then they said, “No, no. You agreed to meet.” I said, “Well, what the hell is that? It’s a plane trip and it’s back and forth.” That’s okay.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (34:38)\n",
      "But you know the sanctions were all left. Nobody’s ever been sanctioned like them. Or Russia, by the way. Russia. Not only the pipeline, but Russia, look at the sanctions on Russia. Nobody’s ever, yet I got along great with Putin. But I got along great with Kim Jong-un. Got along great with everyone. Not all of them liked me. Germany’s ripping us off on trade. They understood that. So when I want to reduce 52,000 soldiers, take out 25,000 soldiers, which costs us just tens of billions of dollars, everyone goes crazy. But I did the right thing and they would have done anything, but now they want to put everybody back. It’s a shame.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (35:15)\n",
      "Biden’s also beholden to America’s enemies and so beholden, nobody’s ever seen anything, that he actually criticized Israel while the Jewish homeland was under attack by thousands and thousands of rockets and missiles launched by Iran. It was launched by Iran. It was a betrayal of Israel when you look at what happened in Congress. It used to be, 10 years ago, 12 years ago, 15 years ago, everybody was with Israel. Today, I guess it’s just not in vogue. But look at some of these radicals that they have in the House of Representatives, you have to deal with them all the time. Israel’s almost out. It’s almost out. It’s a very, very-\n",
      "Donald Trump: (36:03)\n",
      "… out. It’s almost out. It’s a very, very terrible thing, and Biden foolishly eliminated the travel ban on terror-afflicted countries. I said, “I don’t want people in from countries that blow up each other. I don’t want them in. I don’t want people in that are going to blow up our shopping centers. I don’t want people in that are going to blow up our cities.”\n",
      "Donald Trump: (36:20)\n",
      "And I won in court. They said I didn’t win, and they were right. I lost at the lower court, I lost at the second court, and then I won at the Supreme Court, or we have a travel ban, and now they want to give it up. When the press talks about the travel ban, do you ever notice that, “He lost him court”? And they’re right. I lost here, I lost there. And then I won. We got the travel ban. They don’t mention the last one, but we have a travel ban, and they are ending the travel ban, as I understand it. So they don’t mind people coming in that like to blow things up and kill people.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (36:52)\n",
      "And he’s taking action to increase the number of refugee admissions by 700%. This is [inaudible 00:37:01] stuff. But it’ll soon be by over 2,000% and that’ll go up and up and up, and I don’t know what they’re doing. They don’t need them for voting. And a lot of people say they want them for voting, but they don’t need them because they cheat so much in the voting you don’t have to go through this process. Okay? They don’t need them. I keep saying, “They don’t need them for voting. They just throw the ballots in there. Why do we need people coming in? We don’t need that. We’ll just throw those ballots in there,” and many other things.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (37:29)\n",
      "Yep, they’re destroying our country, and now Biden is being openly mocked by China’s negotiators and Russian president Putin. And they’re taunting him and they’re laughing at him and they’re humiliating our country. And do you ever notice when he had a hard time going up the stairs on the plane, nobody talks about that. Nobody talks. The news didn’t cover. Not one network covered it. Now, when I made the best speech I’ve ever made, they said it was at West Point and it was pouring, and I a ramp that was an ice skating rink. And I called, I said to the general, I said, “General, I may have to grab you, because the last thing I’m doing is going down.”\n",
      "Donald Trump: (38:07)\n",
      "So I walked gingerly down. That was on every newscast in the world, and I never went down. I never went on my ass, I’ll tell you. I wasn’t going to fall. I think that was a booby trap. I’ll never forget that ramp. That was like a sheet of ice. It was cold, rainy, and that ramp was long and steep. I said, “General, I might have to grab you, but I’m not going down under.” And unfortunately, I wasn’t wearing American shoes. I had Italian shoes, nice leather. Leather. It’s like an ice skating rink, but they made that a big story, but they didn’t make the Biden fall, the triple fall. I call it the triple fall.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (38:47)\n",
      "Under my administration. America was respected again, totally respected. We withdrew from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal. We stood with Israel, recognized Jerusalem as its eternal capital, and recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. They’ve been working on that for 55 years and I got it done. We decimated the ranks of the world’s top terrorists. You know that. We got our allies to pay their fair share. We stood up for our freedoms and for our country. And we stood up to America’s adversaries, like never before.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (39:29)\n",
      "Nobody’s ever done what we’ve done. I got other countries with NATO to pay. We were paying for NATO. We were paying for NATO. I got them to pay $430 billion. Nobody knows. Nobody. You don’t read about that. The head of NATO is probably my single biggest fan, the secretary general of NATO. They couldn’t believe. So we were getting ripped off on trade. Okay? And on top of it, we were protecting them militarily. And how about Germany? They pay Putin, they pay Russia billions of dollars for energy. And then we protect Germany from Russia. How does that work?\n",
      "Donald Trump: (40:09)\n",
      "Think of it. They pay Russia billions and billions for the pipeline that nobody even knew was being built until I started making it a big case, because I said, “Why are you doing this? You’re paying them billions of dollars, and then we’re protecting you from them. What the hell kind of a deal are we? What are we doing?” It’s not believed. I could name so many. I could say so many different things. South Korea. I got them to pay hundreds of millions of dollars a year. They hadn’t paid for years and years and years anything substantial. And my deal was, they’re going to pay billions of dollars and it would have already taken place. And I refused to renew the deal. The deal expired. He knows better than anybody. I said, “We’ll go on a month-to-month basis.” Do you believe it? “We want a five-year deal.” I said, “No, no, no, because you’re not paying us. Why are we protecting you? You took our television business, you built the ships, you built everything, you’re making a fortune and you’re not paying us for military protection, and we’re protecting you against a very hostile nation. Why?”\n",
      "Donald Trump: (41:11)\n",
      "And they were very angry. They’re great negotiators. But finally, they agreed to pay hundreds of millions of dollars, and it was because their budget had already been passed. I said, “That’s okay, but in January, February, we’re going to meet and you’re going to pay us $5 billion a year,” and they said, “No, no, no,” but I can tell when they’re about ready to fold. So we didn’t renew the deal, and we were going to get billions and billions of dollars from South Korea, who we protect. And they’re great. They’re wonderful. Everything’s wonderful. But we were being taken advantage of.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (41:45)\n",
      "Again, kill us on trade and kill us on the military. And what happened? They just renewed it for a cost-of-living increase. Think of it. A cost-of-living increase. So we’ve been protecting them for 85 years, and they’ll pay if you ask them. Nobody asks. In fact, they said. I said, “Why are we paying for your military?” “Because that is the way it has always been.” Well, that’s not a great answer, I didn’t think. I said, “But that won’t be the way.” But I guess he turned out to be right, because they just got a cost of living, think of that, a cost-of-living increase of less than 1%.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (42:24)\n",
      "We would have gotten at least $5 billion from them. We fully rebuilt the U.S. military and created the first new branch of the United States armed forces in 75 years, called the Space Force, so desperately needed. A lot of people, a lot of things happening right here on this Space Force too. We ended the forever wars in Iraq and Syria and Somalia and Afghanistan. We brought them back home, and this is just the finishing little. We brought them back home. We’re down to very few soldiers in any of those places.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (42:55)\n",
      "And I’m very proud of it. These were the endless wars. So bad, so bad. I’d visit soldiers at Walter Reed Hospital, where the doctors are truly fantastic what they can do, but I’d see these young people that were just blown to pieces, and it’s so sad. I’d be at Dover where these magnificent machines would come in, the big cargo planes, and that door would open up and there’d be a coffin in the back. And the military, the soldiers, would take that coffin and walk it off the plane. And I’d be with the parents an hour before and we’d be talking, and I’d say to the general in-charge, “General, the parents seemed to be okay,” and he’d say, “No, they’re not, sir. They’re not okay.”\n",
      "Donald Trump: (43:45)\n",
      "I said, “General, I’m having a great conversation.” And the mothers oftentimes would say, “Oh, my son was such a great football player. Sir, he had an arm that was so powerful. He was so strong and he could throw a ball so far. He was such a good player,” or other things. They’d tell me these stories. They just were so in love with telling the stories about their son or their daughter, in some cases, their daughter.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (44:08)\n",
      "And then, I’d look at the general. I’d say, “Well, it’s amazing the way they can handle it.” And then, the plane would come in and the general would say, “Sir, it’s not going to be good.” And that door would open up, that big back door, right, would open up from this incredible, powerful machine that can lift up Army tanks like it’s nothing. And it would open up, and there’d be one or two or three or four coffins, and I’d see the same people that were talking to me so jubilant about their child, how great the child was, would start screaming, screaming. Screams like I’ve never heard before.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (44:50)\n",
      "It was the most terrible thing to watch. And the general in charge would say, “Sir, you’re going to see things that you maybe will not have seen.” “Like what, General?” He said, “Mothers and wives, and even fathers sometimes, breaking through the military ranks and jumping on top of the coffin.” And I got to see that one time where a mother, she was devastated. She jumped on and these incredible, extremely fit soldiers are taking that coffin, and would jump onto the coffin, and hey wouldn’t do a thing, they would just keep walking.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (45:35)\n",
      "And the mother was on the coffin, and this is for Afghanistan and for Iraq, and for these other places, where so many mistakes were made, where we shouldn’t be, and we can’t do that. And we’re moving them out. We’re moving them back. 21 years. You know, you’ve heard 19 years, but it’s not 19. Now it’s 21 years in Afghanistan. It’s enough. And we haven’t lost a soldier in Afghanistan since January of last year. Not one single soldier’s been lost. Pretty amazing. It’s pretty amazing.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (46:15)\n",
      "So it’s hard to believe the records the Biden administration is doing. And I’m very glad that he’s continuing to move them out. I think it would be very hard to stop, to be honest. I think, frankly, stopping would be very, very hard, but so I’m very honored by the fact that they’re continuing to bring those soldiers home where they belong. And we have other things to possibly get ready for, because the bigger ballgame, we have to be respected as a military power, because if we’re not respected, these other countries that are very big, very powerful countries, they will take advantage of us, and you know what I mean by that.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (46:49)\n",
      "So we cannot be doing what we’ve been doing for the last very long period of time. When we got into Iraq, I said, as a private individual, many years ago, “Don’t go. But if you’re going to go, keep the oil.” We didn’t keep the oil, and they make a lot of money with that oil. I know how much money they make. They make a lot of money. And we are looked upon as not very smart people and not a very smart country. So we’re doing things that nobody thought were possible. The radical Democrat Party has become consumed by the unquenchable thirst of power. You know that. I don’t know. It’s a term that I’ve heard for a long time. They want power, power, power. I don’t know. I think it’s power, it’s money. I think it’s a lot of things. I don’t think it’s just power. It’s too ridiculous. They want to take away freedom of speech. They want to take away religious liberty. And Biden has already introduced legislation in Congress to take away your guns. You know, your guns are under siege. You do know that. I told you all these things.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (47:55)\n",
      "Again, nobody ever thought what is happening would happen. In Texas, I said, “We’re going to win.” We won Texas by a lot. We won Texas, but they were against oil, guns, and God. And then you’d listen to the fake news. It’s going to be a very close race in Texas. It wasn’t very close at all. Republicans must never waiver in protecting the second amendment and keep and bear arms. We have to keep. We have to have that power to keep and bear arms. If we don’t, we will have a problem like nobody’s ever seen before.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (48:33)\n",
      "But they want to take away your guns. And I said it before the election and I say it after the election. The Biden administration has also issued regulations to indoctrinate America’s school children with poisonous and divisive left-wing doctrines, such as critical race theory, and exact opposite of the American belief that we all are created equal in the holy image of God. We have a group of people, I don’t know where they come from, but it’s hell, I think.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (49:03)\n",
      "Just as the state house of representatives has done right here in North Carolina, Republicans at every level should move immediately to ban critical race theory in our schools. And we should ban it in workplaces. We should ban it in our states, and we should ban it in the federal government, that it should be done immediately. It should be done very quickly.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (49:41)\n",
      "Washington Democrats are also pushing legislation to spend billions and billions of dollars on phony civic education, giving students academic credit to show up at protests. Can you believe that? And make themselves into left-wing activists. And how badly do they treat people that tend to be on the right compared to people that are on the radical left? Look at what happened in Portland. Nothing’s happening with these people, and they do kill people and they burn down buildings and they go after federal buildings and nothing happens. And people are damn angry about it.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (50:19)\n",
      "If government-run schools are going to indoctrinate children with radical ideas, Republicans must immediately pass legislation to empower every parent in America to opt out of the insanity and send their child to the public private charter or religious school of their choice. The socialist Democrats quests for whatever it is they’re looking for, because nobody knows, I don’t even think they know, truly knows no bounds.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (51:03)\n",
      "The slander that they cause, they slander our country, disparage our founding, divide our children. And as we’ve seen time and time again in recent years, the left is willing to weaponize the law itself to persecute their political opponents. There are people in this room that have been persecuted. In New York, radical left prosecutors are right now spending vast amounts of time and money threatening families and trying to destroy the lives of innocent people, really, really good people, in their crusade to inflict pain on me, the radical left movement in New York.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (51:43)\n",
      "There’s no place where it’s worse or more corrupt. And most importantly, to stop our movement, 75 million voters plus, plus, plus. That’s what I say. Hundreds of thousands of dollars of radical-left Democrat money had been paid to these prosecutors in the form of campaign contributions. Go get Trump. Go get him. And now, a new group of far-left Democrats are seeking the prosecutor’s office, all fighting for who will be the toughest on Trump.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (52:13)\n",
      "They’re going to get elected, whoever’s the vicious the most tough. They don’t know anything about me. “We’re going to get Trump.” “What did he do?” “Well, we don’t know, but we’ll figure it out.” Washington Post reported the other day, they’ve gotten millions of pages of documents. Well, when did he do a deal? Did he do another deal? They’re going through every deal I’ve ever done, millions and millions of pages. If there’s a comma, mistake, if there’s a misspelling, it’s problems. You know what? It’s a disgrace to our country. It’s prosecutorial misconduct.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (52:48)\n",
      "They’re in search of a crime. It’s a fishing expedition, and the Supreme Court of the United States should not have allowed it to happen. Shouldn’t have allowed it. And they mentioned, it can’t be a fishing expedition. This is the ultimate fishing expedition. It’s been a five-year long witch hunt, hoax after hoax, Russia, Russia, Russia, Ukraine, the Mueller hoax. Look at the Mueller scam. How well did he do before Congress? It wasn’t too good, was it?\n",
      "Donald Trump: (53:19)\n",
      "Lie after lie, corrupt investigation after corrupt investigation. Do you remember when they found out it was Hillary Clinton and the Democrats that paid for the dossier, the fake news dossier, the fake dossier? It was Hillary Clinton. And they got more than the great James Patterson. This guy, Christopher Steele, I don’t know who the hell he is, but he sure as hell hated me.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (53:44)\n",
      "It was a total phony deal paid for by the Democrats and crooked Hillary Clinton. And nothing happens to them. And by the way, where’s Durham? What happened to Durham? Where is he? Has anyone seen Durham? All of this for nothing. It’s a shame, it’s a shame. They do things a little bit differently. We’ll never let it happen.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (54:03)\n",
      "It’s a shame. They do things a little bit differently. We’ll never let it happen again. Now they just send the same information from the no collusion Mueller investigation to corrupt politicians in New York, they send everything that they’ve already gone over and over, send it into New York, let the radical left prosecutors go after Trump. Just give it a shot, they say, give it a shot. They failed in Washington. They failed all over the place. Between the impeachment hoax number one, impeachment hoax number two, all of these investigations, ah shit, we failed. Let’s send it to the radical left prosecutors in New York, maybe they can have more luck. They’ll never stop until November of 2024. They won’t stop. There’s no better example of the Democrat and media corruption than the 2020 election hoax. As you know, the evidence is too voluminous to even mention. All you have to do is read the article in Time magazine, cover story in Time magazine. I’m not a big fan, I was on the cover a lot, perhaps a record, a lot. I got to a point if I was ever on the cover, I was on the cover of Time magazine before I did this political thing and I read every word. I said, I wonder what that means. It was actually a very good story, I used to actually get good press, can you believe it? I guess that’s how I got to be president when you think about it. But I used to get great press. But Time magazine did a story. They couldn’t help themselves. They had to brag about what they did in November. They had to brag and that story just goes 25% of the way.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (55:51)\n",
      "But if you take it a little bit further, you’ll just read that and you see how corrupt, but that’s the least of it. You look at what happened on that evening when the election was won and all of a sudden vast amounts of votes were taken in just in certain states, swing states. Swing states that I was leading by a lot. Then all of a sudden, oh, something happened. It was a disgrace to our country and if you think people don’t see it, people see it. People have seen it. The 2020 presidential election, that election, the 2020 presidential election was by far the most corrupt election in the history of our country. There’s never been anything like this. They used COVID and they used the mail-in ballots to steal an election. It was the third world country election like we’ve never seen before. Look at what took place. I want to congratulate by the way, Republican state senators in Arizona and other places for their great work that they are doing in exposing this fraud.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (57:08)\n",
      "And maybe again, I have nothing to do with the Arizona situation, they’re doing it, the state senate of Arizona, because they have so many discrepancies, so many problems. And they’ve heard from so many people about the corruption and what took place, so they’re doing it. Let’s see what happens. They’ll be finished in three or four weeks. It’ll be very interesting, but I’ll tell you, and maybe they’ll find nothing. Maybe they’ll say, oh, it was a wonderful, perfect election, but maybe not. And now they’re looking at it in Pennsylvania and they’re looking at it in Georgia. And they’re looking at it in many other states because they’re saying the same things happened to us.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (57:48)\n",
      "That election will go down as the crime of the century and our country is being destroyed by people who perhaps have no right to destroy it. Zuckerberg broke the law spending millions of dollars. Don’t you think he broke the law? Millions of dollars to get out the vote efforts in highly Democrat areas. He used to come to the White House. He would call, “Oh, could I have dinner with you, sir?” “Sure.” “Could I bring my wife?” “Oh, absolutely.” He actually walked into the office one day in front of numerous people, “Congratulations, sir.” “Why?” He said. “You’re number one on Facebook.” He said to me, “You’re number one on Facebook.” I said, “Thank you very much. I appreciate it.” We had a nice dinner. The day I was out he became a rather, well, I guess it’s human nature. But we can’t let our country be run by that kind of human nature can we? Zuckerberg, it’s another beauty.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (58:48)\n",
      "But they say they may allow me back in two years. No, I’m not too interested in that. They may allow me back in two years, we got to stop that, we can’t let it happen. So unfair, they’re shutting down an entire group of people, not just me. They’re shutting down the voice of a tremendously powerful, in my opinion, a much more powerful and a much larger group. Because you know what, when the Democrats say defund the police, open borders, sanctuary cities, all of these horrible, horrible cancel culture things, their policy is terrible. And I say a lot now there’s no way they go 50, 50, who the hell wants to defend the police? Look at what’s happening where they’re defunding the police, the crime rate is going up by 50, 60, 100%. 131% in one city. They don’t even know what to do, but they keep doing it.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (59:40)\n",
      "The policy is so bad. You know what, they’re smart and I said, they’re vicious and they stick together. But I don’t believe it’s 50, 50 because our country isn’t there. We’re not a 50, 50 country to defund the police and to have sanctuary cities where criminals are allowed to be protected. I’m telling you, I think a lot of these elections where they always seem to have an advantage, I don’t believe it. I can’t believe that some of these states that are blue, that they’re blue. I know those people, they’re smart people. And I see so many people. They love me because they love what I stand for. And they’re not into these things. There’s something going on and we have to be very, very careful with our election process because I don’t believe we’re a 50, 50 nation where these states are split evenly. They can’t be split. This is corrupt elections possibly and we can’t allow it to go on.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:00:37)\n",
      "And I can tell you, and you’ll see it because more and more it’s coming out. The things that happened in the recent election, dead people voting, dead people. Worse is dead people voting who had to apply to vote. It’s true. You had people that are dead that applied to vote. And by the way, I’m talking about thousands of people, thousands and thousands of people, dead people. Illegal aliens voting. Indians getting paid to vote in certain states, including Arizona and Nevada, getting paid to vote. You’re not allowed to get paid to vote. It’s a terrible thing that’s going on. We have to clean up those rolls, we have to do so many things or we’re not going to have a country. If you don’t have election integrity and if you don’t have strong borders, our country can be run like a dictatorship and that’s what they’d like to do.\n",

      "I don’t even think Biden is the dictator. If anybody knows who the hell is running that operation, could you let us know? Because I don’t think it’s Joe but who the hell knows maybe it is. Maybe it is. And with all of the things currently going on, especially the prosecutorial misconduct that’s going on at a level like nobody’s seen for many, many years, that’s all that’s happening. And that’s what they’re doing. They want to silence you, they want to silence your voice. Remember, I am not the one trying to undermine American democracy. I’m the one that’s trying to save it, please remember that. Thank you. Thank you, thank you.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:02:28)\n",
      "We all know what happened with the election and we can never ever let that happen again. And we’re going to go forward and we’re going to continue to look, and things are being found that is not even believable. But we have to do that because without going back, you’re not going to go forward. The thing that I get most is, “Sir, we can’t let that happen again. If we’re going to work and work, and spend money, and make contributions. Sir, will the same thing happen in 2022 to Ted and to other people? Will the same thing happen has happened in ’20?” We have to be able to say absolutely not. That’s why I love what they’ve done in Texas. I love what they’re doing in Florida and done in Florida. I would like to see Georgia be much tougher, they don’t have signature verification, they don’t have things, that Georgia has to be tougher. But I love what’s going on in so many states, 41 different states. Because they saw what happened in this last disaster and they don’t want it to happen again.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:03:34)\n",
      "And the only way you’re going to be able to really solve that problem is to figure out exactly what happened. And you know what, they’re going to be able to do that. In light of so many outrageous wrongs, Republicans across the country are pursuing voting reforms to ensure election integrity. One of the biggest things that I hear is election integrity. Joe Biden called these common sense reforms un-American. But the thing that is really un-American is an election scam, that’s un-American. All over the world, they used to say, oh, they’re the land of the free, they have great elections. We don’t have great elections. We have elections like probably very few countries have. And that’s in a bad way, not in a good way. What happened to this country in that last election was a disgrace and it’s being laughed at, and viewed all over the world.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:04:24)\n",
      "And I can tell you, China is extremely happy about it. And Russia is extremely happy about it. They’re all very, very happy about it. Probably in order, I would say China and then I would say Iran, and then I would say many countries. I could go through a list of them, but China is certainly happy. Iran is certainly happy. And think of it, if the bill passed by the House Democrats, HR1, is ever signed into law, there will never be another fair election in our country. It can’t get worse but it would be almost as bad as the recent presidential election. To fully secure every future election, we must have photo ID, universal signature verification, citizenship confirmation, chain of custody, integrity controls, updated voter rolls for every election. You got to update those voter rolls, not people that have been dead for nine years.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:05:25)\n",
      "We can’t have illegal aliens allowed to vote. Strong protection of poll watchers, our poll watchers, our poor, poor poll watchers. What happened to them in Philadelphia, what happened to them in Detroit, where they were literally thrown out of election for days, and were actually afraid for their lives. And we can not have dropboxes paid for by Facebook and Zuckerberg. Where, by the way, massive numbers, 95, 96% of the vote is for Joe Biden, doesn’t happen. You ever see these dropboxes, some of them came back very late. They got lifted, taken. Where are they a day later? Where are they? Oh, they’re coming. Oh great, that’s wonderful. 96% for Joe Biden. We must eliminate the absurdity of mass mail-in voting and people should vote in person on Election Day. Not over weeks and months where all sorts of things can happen and they’re not good things for our country. And there should have to be a legitimate reason for someone to vote absentee. There are people that deserve it. They’re sick, they’re at a certain age, they can’t make it, and they love our country. There’s a certain group of people, military, but to do what you did, where you were sending out millions and millions…\n",
      "Donald Trump: (00:40)\n",
      "By the way, I don’t know if, those of you that are really into the world of politics, you know that I called this long before what I heard what they were doing, how they were allowed to do this. Millions and millions of ballots, some people got six, some people got seven ballots. To send out millions of ballots, to allow that to happen to our country… We know the radical left will stop at nothing in their efforts to destroy the America we love, but with the help of righteous American Patriots like all of you in this room, they will fail. Our movement is far from over. In fact, it is just getting started.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (01:19)\n",
      "Here in North Carolina, across the country ,the Republican party will continue to fight for strong families, safe communities, and secure and sovereign borders. We will fight for more jobs, lower taxes, and pro-American trade deals that result in more North Carolina workers, forging more products, stamped with beautiful, beautiful phrases, but in particular made in the USA, Mr. Furniture Manufacturer. We will shut down outsourcing, bring back our supply chains, crack down on trade cheaters and violators, and ensure that America, not China, dominates the future of the world. We will protect innocent life. We will defend our glorious constitution and we will uphold the Judeo-Christian values and principles of our nation’s founding.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (02:28)\n",
      "We will break up the big tech monopolies, reject left-wing cancel culture, restore free speech in America, and demand free, fair and honest transparent elections. We will strengthen our military, support our great police, and always take care of our amazing veterans. Do you know that we got a 92% approval rating with respect to the VA. They rated us 92% approval rating. It’s never been anywhere even near that number. Very proud of that. With the American pride that fills our souls, we will teach our children to love their country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag.\n",
      "Donald Trump: (03:23)\n",
      "Tomorrow marks the 77th anniversary of one of the most epic military trial in the history of the world, the allied invasion of Normandy on D-Day. As we remember this incredible achievement, let us summon the spirit of generations of Americans before us who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for our beloved country. All of us in this room inherit the legacy of the selfless patriots who won the battles, crossed the oceans, forged the steel, made the breakthroughs, climbed the summits, these great, beautiful summits, tamed the frontiers and seized the victories that built America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world. That’s where we want to keep it. That is our magnificent American inheritance, and there is nothing like it anywhere in the world, and there never will be. Let us go forward tonight, moved by their sacrifice, motivated by their example, inspired by their resolve, committed to their values and more determined than ever to make America prouder, freer, stronger, and greater than ever before. Thank you, North Carolina. God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you.\n",
